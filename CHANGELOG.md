## [6.1.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed — RAINTYPE0 hybrid

This release is a wholesale **rebrand + hybrid restart**. The 6.0.1
codebase is retired in favour of a modular ES-module rebuild that
ports the classic monosrc gameplay forward while keeping a curated
set of rainsrc enhancements. Powerups, drops, inventory, assists,
shop, leveling, multiplayer, and the WebGL renderer are **all gone**.
See `PORT-ANALYSIS.md` for the full ledger.

- **Project renamed** `Rainboids` → `RAINTYPE0`. localStorage keys
  switch to the `raintype0*` namespace; old `rainboids*` keys are
  orphaned in the user's browser.
- **Modular ES-module layout** under `js/core`, `js/platform`,
  `js/audio`, `js/entities`, `js/world`, `js/ui`. Zero build step;
  `npm run dev` serves via `npx http-server`.
- **Classic gameplay restored**: 12-vertex icosahedron asteroids,
  rainbow bullets (now straight, no sine wave), shaped twinkling
  starfield with parallax, burst stars on destruction, motion-blur
  veil, CRT scanline overlay, animated colour-cycling title.
- **Asteroid visual upgrade** (kept from rainsrc HEAD): per-rock unique
  hue palette + time-cycled wireframe + black underlay pass for
  legibility against starfield; localised radial flash + propagating
  wavefront across edges on bullet hit; directional debris streaks.
- **Collision skip-glitch fixed**: asteroid–asteroid exchanges only
  fire when pairs are actually closing along the contact normal;
  no positional correction means overlapping rocks don't teleport.
- **Continuous spawning** replaces wave-based: asteroids spawn
  off-screen on a timer, target count scales gently with score, hard
  cap on simultaneous parent rocks for perf.
- **Mobile: single analog stick + auto-aim + auto-fire** (Sky Force /
  Galaxy Attack model). Stick = movement only; ship auto-aims at
  nearest asteroid and auto-fires when target is in ±25° cone.
- **Desktop: reverse thrust** added — Down arrow applies thrust along
  the ship's tail, with forward-spraying thrust particles.
- **Title-screen attractor**: drifting stars + slowly tumbling
  pulsing asteroids run on the canvas behind the RAINTYPE0 letters
  with the full motion-blur aesthetic; subtle radial vignette frames
  the title.
- **Playlist-aware music player** carried over from rainsrc HEAD;
  shuffled at session start, random first track; preload-next for
  gapless feel; play/pause/prev/next surfaced in the pause menu.
- **Cleaned-up pause menu**: BGM + SFX volumes, mutes, now-playing,
  prev/play/next; no skills / assists / shop / inventory tabs.

## [6.0.1] - 2026-05-16

### Changed — Healing balance pass

- **`getEffectiveRegen()` hard-capped at 3.0 HP/s**. Stacking the
  REGEN powerup with an epic trinket primary + 4× secondary regen
  affixes was pushing out-of-combat heal past 10 HP/s, making the 4-
  second damage gate trivial to wait out.
- **FIELD_SURGEON is now ADDITIVE with FIELD_RATIONS** (was
  multiplicative). Combined ceiling 2.5× the raw orb value —
  RATIONS ×3 = +90%, SURGEON = +50%, additive total 2.4×, cap leaves
  a sliver of headroom for the max to land. Previous behavior chained
  to 2.85× silently.
- **ADRENAL_RESERVE gains a 15s internal cooldown.** Without it the
  desperation drop surge at low HP could refill every orb's worth of
  tanks back-to-back, effectively giving the player unlimited spare
  lives during recovery windows.
- **Boss item rarity bias trimmed** from `+20% rare / +15% epic` to
  `+10% rare / +8% epic`. Boss rolls still feel jackpot-y (~16% epic
  vs the base 8%) but don't shortcut the rarity drip.

### Added — Wave HUD + rarity-tagged pickup toast

- The HUD shield that used to read **LV** now reads **WV** and
  displays the current wave number. Position unchanged so muscle
  memory holds; semantics are now wave-driven (the LV display was a
  no-op since 6.0.0).
- Pickup toasts now prefix the item name with `[COMMON]` / `[RARE]` /
  `[EPIC]`. Rare+ pickups also adopt the rarity color as the toast
  accent so the tier reads at a glance.
- Stats overlay (\` key): LEVEL + XP summary cells removed; WAVE is
  promoted to the leftmost cell. Gold Find tooltip updated to read
  "per wave" instead of "per player level".

### Removed — SP / leveling cruft sweep

- **`js/modules/shop/shop-renderer.js` deleted** — already
  unreferenced since 5.79.60 (game-engine import removed). 552 lines
  of dead canvas-renderer code gone.
- **`spAmt` / `picksAmt` DOM element refs removed** from
  `shop-dom.js` — the matching `<shop-sp-amount>` / `<shop-picks-amount>`
  elements were never present in `index.html`, so the lookups
  returned null and the conditional guards in `updateShopCurrencyDom`
  were running on every shop refresh for nothing.
- **HELP panel slimmed to gold only** — SP + XP entries removed
  (both retired in 6.0.0).
- **`buildItemRow` SP / PICKS branches collapsed** — shop is gold-
  only now, so the multi-currency canAfford check and price-cell
  rendering reduce to "owned → equip / free → take / else gold".
- **Sell button is gold-only** — the `SELL +N SP` branch removed.
- **`shop-manager.buyShopItem` SP/PICKS branch collapsed** to a
  single gold deduction.
- **`progression.js` commented-out original bodies deleted** —
  `gainExperience`, `levelUp`, `grantLevelUpBonus`,
  `triggerLevelUpEffects`, and the SP-unspent toast block. Git
  history has the originals; the no-op stubs stay (1-2 lines each).
- **10× `this.player.gainExperience(N)` calls removed** from
  `collision-system.js`. They were calling the no-op stub and added
  per-frame indirection for nothing.
- **`updateTempBonuses()` + `levelUpAnimation` tick removed** from
  `player.update()` — both fields are no longer populated.
- **`spCost` fields removed from `weapon-data.js`** (all 10 entries
  across PRIMARY_WEAPONS + POWER_WEAPONS). Nothing reads `spCost`
  anymore.

### Notes

- All 948 unit tests still pass after the sweep.
- Test files retain `skillPoints = N` seeds and SP-spend logging —
  noise but not breaking. A later cleanup pass can excise those.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-05-16

### Removed — Player leveling, XP, and SP

Player no longer levels. `gainExperience`, `levelUp`, `grantLevelUpBonus`,
`triggerLevelUpEffects`, and the XP-curve helpers are all no-op stubs
(originals preserved in `/* … */` comments inside
`js/modules/player/progression.js`). The LV shield + XP bar in the HUD
are no-op renderers (early return); the pause-menu "SP AVAILABLE" badge
is gone. Player-level damage / drop scaling fully retired — see Changed
below for replacements.

### Changed — Wave is the new "level"

Drop chance, drop quantity, heal amount, money amount, and gold-find
multiplier now scale with the CURRENT WAVE instead of player level.
Same curve shapes, same end-game targets. Beating a wave is the
progression event (survivor cards already fire at wave-clear; see
"Boss bonus" below for the milestone reward layer).

### Changed — Powerups purchased with GOLD, not SP

The pause-menu POWERUPS tab and the shop both deduct from
`game.money` now. A new `powerupGoldCost(cfg, stacks)` helper in
`js/modules/world/powerup.js` derives a per-stack price from
`goldCost` / `goldCostIncrement` (explicit) or the legacy `spCost`
field (mapped at ~500 g/SP + tier-2 bump). Banner reads "GOLD
AVAILABLE"; buy buttons read "1500 G", etc. SP-currency branches in
the shop fall through to gold deduction.

### Added — Item rarity tiers + rolled primary stat + trinket slot

Items now drop in three rarities — common (65%) / rare (27%) /
epic (8%) — that drive:

1. **Rolled primary stat**: each tier rolls a multiplier band over
   the wave-based base (common 0.85–1.05×, rare 1.00–1.40×,
   epic 1.35–1.85×). An epic ≈ 2× a common at the same wave.
2. **Visual glow**: pickup halo color (grey/blue/purple) so the
   player can read tier at a distance.
3. **Name adjective**: rare adds "Fine", epic adds "Pristine"
   before the existing `[Prefix] [Base] [Suffix]` pattern.

A new 5th slot — **trinket** — drops items whose primary IS regen
(HP/s). HP/toughness items can still roll a secondary regen affix.
All slots use a unified `scoreItem` formula (HP=1pt, DEF=8pt/%,
regen=16pt/HP·s, +8 weight on secondary regen) so cross-affix
comparisons work cleanly.

**Drop suppression**: items are pre-rolled at drop time and only
spawned as a `StatPickup` when they're a strict upgrade over the
currently-equipped slot. Anything that appears on-screen is
guaranteed to improve the build — no more chasing duplicates.

### Added — Health-drop survival powerups (10)

`HEALTH_DROP_FREQUENCY` (Triage) promoted from defense-shop into
`POWERUP_TYPES` alongside nine new health-drop levers, all priced
in gold and available from the pause-menu POWERUPS tab + survivor
cards:

- **Triage** — −2.5s drop cooldown / stack (12s floor)
- **Lucky Drops** — +12% drop chance / stack
- **Field Rations** — +30% heal magnitude / stack
- **Triage Surge** — steeper desperation curve at low HP
- **Combat Medic** — first kill within 8s of taking damage drops a
  guaranteed orb (8s cd)
- **Salvage Plating** — popping an energy tank spawns a health orb
- **Triage Net** — 2× pickup magnet on health orbs
- **Adrenal Reserve** — at ≤25% HP, next orb also refills a tank
- **Field Surgeon** — +50% heal per orb
- **Blood Bank** — overflow → tank fills 2× faster

### Added — Desperation drop curve

Health-drop chance is multiplied by `1 + k × (1 − hp/maxHp)²`. Base
`k = 1.5`; `TRIAGE_SURGE` adds +1.0 per stack. Below 25% HP the
cooldown floor is also halved. At full HP it's a no-op; at 10% HP
with maxed Surge a player sees roughly 4× the normal drop rate.
Resets when a tank pops (since tanks refill to max HP).

### Added — Boss-wave bonus powerup

Boss-wave clears (waves 5/10/15/20/25/30) auto-grant a second random
non-maxed powerup on top of the regular survivor card. Boss item
drops also bias the rarity roll (+20% rare, +15% epic) and bump per-
slot drop rates (3.4× HP slots, 3.75× toughness, 4× trinket) so
boss kills feel jackpot-y.

### Notes

- Existing test suites that assert on `player.level`, `gainExperience`,
  or `skillPoints` will fail — those are no-op fields now. Update or
  skip with a `6.0.0 — leveling retired` rationale comment.
- Shop currently sells weapon upgrades only (DEFENSE economy already
  suspended in 5.79.57). Old SP-currency branches now fall through to
  gold deduction defensively.

## [5.121.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed — Health drop pool expanded to four solids

Added cube + octahedron back to the rotation. They were already
defined in `HEALTH_SHAPE_GEOMETRY` as inert data and render cleanly
under the painter's-algorithm path. Prism (the triangular battery-
shape) deleted entirely — never wanted for this pool.

Final health drop pool — 4 well-known platonic-style solids:

- **tetrahedron** (pyramid)
- **cube**
- **octahedron**
- **dodecahedron**

Prism geometry data (`_PRISM_VS`, `prismFaces`, `prismEdges`) +
registry entry removed from `HEALTH_SHAPE_GEOMETRY`. The
background-star renderer's atlas still lists `prism` since it
serves decorative parallax stars — that's a separate consumer
and stays untouched.

## [5.120.0] - 2026-05-16

### Removed — Stella octangula health-drop shape

The 3D-star shape (stellated octahedron) is gone. Even after the
5.119.0 vertex-parity fix produced a correct stella geometrically,
the painter's-algorithm renderer drew it as a rotating cube with
star-shaped face cuts — not the clean outward 8-point silhouette
the design wanted. Concave polyhedra need either depth-sorted face
intersection or per-spike rendering to read cleanly, and either
approach is too much complexity for a single drop visual.

Health drop pool tightened to two well-known platonic-style
solids the renderer handles cleanly:

- **pyramid** (tetrahedron)
- **dodecahedron**

Stella verts / faces / edges and the `stella:` registry entry in
`HEALTH_SHAPE_GEOMETRY` deleted. The geometry data for cube /
octahedron / prism stays in the registry — those shapes are
unused by the current pool but cheap to keep around as inert data
in case a future pool revival uses them.

## [5.119.0] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed — Stella octangula "paper-windmill" glitch

The 5.116.0 stella geometry had MIXED-PARITY face indices: each
face used vertices from both inscribed tetrahedra instead of one
or the other. That produced X-shaped intersecting cross-sections
(the "two pieces of paper through each other" the player saw)
instead of two cleanly interpenetrating tetrahedra forming an
8-pointed star.

Diagnosis: a regular dodecahedron inscribed in a cube uses the 4
corners with positive sign-product as one tet, the 4 with negative
as the other. Tet A = {1, 3, 4, 6} (parity +), Tet B = {0, 2, 5, 7}
(parity −). The 5.116 face list mixed verts across the two sets
(e.g. `[1, 4, 2]` paired parity-+ verts 1, 4 with parity-− vert 2).

Fix: rebuilt all 8 stella faces with each face's 3 verts drawn from
ONE tet only. Winding derived per-face by checking that the
cross-product outward normal points AWAY from the opposite vertex.

Stella edges array zeroed too — unused since the painter's-
algorithm renderer landed in 5.117.0 (each face strokes its own
outline).

### Changed — Gold drops mostly gold, jewels rare and worth more

In 5.117.0 every gold shape rolled a random jewel color, which made
the playfield read as "no gold, just gems" and lost the gold-rush
treasure feeling.

Reworked as RARE drop variants:

- **85% gold-colored** (`#ffd700`) — the standard piece.
- **15% jewel** — picks from the 6-color palette (hot pink, ruby
  red, violet, purple, magenta, rose) AND pays out **3× the
  normal gold piece's value**. Rarity has REAL meaning now —
  spotting a jewel in your drop pile is a "yes!" moment.

The 3× value also scales the gem's render radius (radius is
value-driven in gold-shape.js), so jewels read as visibly bigger
+ brighter on the playfield. Average net gold value per drop:
~30% above baseline — meaningful but not gameplay-breaking.

Black border applies to both gold and jewel shapes equally for
consistent background contrast.

## [5.118.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added — Restored gold pixel scatter, now SPARKLING

The tiny-gold-pixel scatter that flew alongside every gold drop was
removed in 5.81.1 because the old 30-pixel chaos was visually noisy.
It's back as a **bounded cosmetic sparkle**:

- 4 + (2 × shapeN) pixels per drop = 6 pixels on small kills, 8 on
  mid kills, 10 on big multi-kills.
- Each pixel is worth 1g flat — sparkle is the point, not value.
  Total drop value still flows through the shape budget (50-300g);
  pixels add a negligible +6 to +10g per kill.

### Changed — `_drawGoldCoinsCanvas2D` → `_drawGoldSparklesCanvas2D`

Renamed to better describe intent — this is the treasure-dust
sparkle layer, not just coins.

Two passes per frame now:

**Pass 1 — pixel bodies** (no composite change, fast loop):
- Each coin picks a shape on reset: **square** (45%), **circle**
  (40%), **dot** (15% — 1×1 pixel). A burst of 8-10 coins reads as
  varied glittering treasure dust instead of identical squares.
- Twinkle modulation: alpha oscillates 0.65 → 1.0 from each coin's
  own `twinklePhase` + `twinkleSpeed`, so coins SPARKLE in place.

**Pass 2 — additive sparkle pulse** (single composite switch):
- Only coins currently in the bright window of their twinkle wave
  (top 30%) draw the additive halo, so typical pass-2 cost is
  roughly half the active coins.
- Each pulse is one small `arc` fill in pale gold (`#fff8b0`) at
  2.5× the coin's pixel size with composite `lighter`.

**Perf**: pass-1 is the existing pixel-art draw; pass-2 adds ~one
arc per half-coin. Typical 6-20 active pixels per kill burst,
fading within seconds → per-frame budget well under 0.5ms.

## [5.117.0] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed — Health drops are now solid, not see-through

Pre-5.117 health orbs used a convex-hull silhouette + front-facing
edge overlay. Two problems:
1. The body fill was a single hull polygon with interior edges drawn
   on top — visible interior lines on a body fill read as "you can
   see through the orb" / "glass polyhedron".
2. For the Stella Octangula (added 5.116.0), the convex hull is a
   cube — so the star's actual silhouette was wrong; the renderer
   drew a cube outline with star-edge lines inside.

5.117.0 rewrites `_drawHealthShape3D` with **painter's algorithm**:

- Project every vertex
- For each face: front-facing test + centroid Z depth
- Sort front-facing faces back-to-front
- Fill + stroke each face individually

Front faces overpaint back faces of the same body color, so the orb
reads as a solid rotating polyhedron. Works correctly for ALL
polyhedra (convex tet / cube / dodecahedron AND the concave Stella
Octangula).

### Changed — Gold shapes are now jewel-colored gems

Gold shapes used to all be `#ffd700` with a dark amber border. They
now roll a random color from a **jewel palette** each spawn:

`#ff44aa` hot pink · `#ff3366` ruby red · `#cc44ff` violet ·
`#9933ee` purple · `#ff44dd` magenta · `#ff5577` rose

Black border (was dark amber) makes the gem read against bright
nebulae AND dark voids. A 3-shape burst from a kill now looks like
SPILLED TREASURE — varied jewel colors scattering — rather than a
wall of identical yellow shapes. The palette deliberately excludes
blue/cyan so health orbs stay instantly type-readable by color.

### Changed — Gold shapes render on Canvas2D (not WebGL atlas)

Pulled `goldShapePool` off the WebGL starfield atlas push because
the atlas couldn't express per-instance borders or per-shape colors
cleanly (silhouettes were pre-baked, tinted globally). New
`_drawGoldShapesCanvas2D` walks the active list and renders each as
a polygon (`_gemPath` helper handles `star4/5/6/8/hexagon/diamond/
triangle`) with the jewel fill + black stroke. An additive top-left
white sheen adds polished gem polish.

Perf: typical 1-10 active gold shapes; per-frame budget well under
0.5ms. Gold coins (the tiny pixel-dot drops) stay on their existing
Canvas2D path unchanged.

## [5.116.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed — Health drops: pyramid / 3D star / dodecahedron

Shape pool tightened from `cube / octahedron / tetrahedron / prism`
to `tetrahedron (pyramid) / stella (3D star) / dodecahedron`. Three
distinct silhouettes that all read as "valuable artifact" and stay
visually clean against gold (flat shapes) + asteroids (organic
blobs).

**New geometry**:
- **stella** — Stellated octahedron (Stella Octangula): two
  interpenetrating tetrahedra forming an 8-pointed 3D star. 8
  vertices at all cube corners, 8 triangular faces (4 per tet).
  Convex hull silhouette is a cube but front-facing edges trace
  the star points as the orb tumbles.
- **dodecahedron** — Regular 12-face polyhedron with 20 golden-ratio
  vertices. Face indexing is the standard layout; edge adjacency
  auto-derived from the face list (walk each pentagon's 5 edges,
  dedupe by min-max vertex pair → each edge knows both adjacent
  faces for the front-facing test).

### Added — Additive glow + inner-core bloom

Health orbs were getting lost against bright nebulae and combat FX.
Glow rewritten using `globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'` so glow
layers ADD to the background — same trick the particle layer uses
for explosions. Three additive layers underneath the body:

1. **Bloom halo** — wide pulsing cyan-blue radial at 2.9-3.4× the
   orb radius. Reads against any background because additive +
   blue means it brightens whatever's behind it instead of
   averaging in.
2. **Inner glow core** — small hot-white-cyan radial that bleeds
   through the body silhouette so the orb looks "lit from within".
3. **Sparkle ring** — four orbiting motes, slightly tightened
   radius (1.55× vs 1.45× in 5.102.0) since additive makes them
   already vivid without needing larger gradients.

Specular sheen (the top-left highlight clipped to the silhouette)
stays NON-additive so it reads as a polished surface reflection
rather than a glow.

**Perf**: 6 gradients per orb per frame (1 bloom + 1 core + 4
sparkle). Typical active health-orb count is 1-5 so the per-frame
budget is well under 0.5ms. `lighter` composite is free in every
browser's canvas backend.

## [5.115.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added — Choreographed enemy formations

New `FormationManager` (`js/modules/enemy/formations.js`) bundles
freshly-spawned enemy groups into coordinated movement plans. The
visual goal: enemies fly together as a CREW instead of every grunt
individually chasing the player.

Five formation types, picked at spawn time per group:
- **orbit** — N enemies evenly spaced on a circle around the player,
  rotating at a steady angular speed.
- **weave** — members trace horizontal sine waves with staggered
  y-offsets and alternating phases so they visibly criss-cross.
- **flank** — two halves arc in from opposite sides simultaneously.
- **cross** — pairs travel along X-shaped trajectories, converging,
  passing through each other, then diverging on a loop.
- **figure8** — Lissajous figure-8 around the player at offset
  phases so members form a moving ribbon.

Spawn-time bundling: any 3+ non-boss group has a 40-85% chance
(scaled by group size) to become a formation. Bosses + mini-bosses
skip — they have scripted positions already. Duration is 6-12s,
radius 180-300px, angular speed 0.45-0.85 rad/s — late-game waves
get bigger / slower formations so the choreography reads.

Lifecycle: per-frame tick computes each member's slot target and
lerps them toward it (formation movement overrides individual AI's
position output; AI still drives rotation, aiming, shooting). When
half the members die OR duration expires, members are released back
to individual AI.

### Added — Soft enemy-enemy separation

Every frame, overlapping enemy pairs push each other apart along
the line between centers. NO damage applied — enemies don't hurt
each other, they just avoid overlap. Keeps formations from
collapsing into a single point and reads as natural "they avoid
each other" behavior. Warping enemies + bosses skip (warping is
the invuln/positioning window; bosses have scripted positions that
shouldn't get nudged).

O(n²) over active enemies; fine for typical counts.

### Changed — Mobile autoPower defaults ON

Previously mobile defaulted to `autoPower: false` (player had to
tap canvas to fire power weapons). With the stationary mobile ship
the player is already busy aiming with a finger; making them tap
to fire too added friction. Default ON; player can opt OUT via
the ASSISTS pause-menu tab. Existing players who explicitly
toggled it OFF keep their setting.

### Changed — Every upgrade + powerup description tersified

All POWERUP_TYPES + PRIMARY_UPGRADES + POWER_UPGRADES descriptions
audited and rewritten:
- Dropped the "per stack" boilerplate (every stackable upgrade has
  it implicitly).
- Use `+` for additive, `×` for multipliers, `/s` for per-second.
- Cut weapon-name suffixes ("(Pulse Cannon)", "(Lance Beam)") since
  the upgrade is shown inside the weapon's tab.
- Examples: "22% faster shooting per stack" → "+22% fire rate";
  "Heal +5% of damage dealt per stack" → "Heal 5% of damage dealt";
  "Survive lethal hit at 1 HP + invuln (once per wave)" →
  "Survive lethal hit at 1 HP, 1/wave".

## [5.114.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — REGEN is now combat-gated

The REGEN powerup used to tick unconditionally while owned. 5.114.0
makes it a between-fights recovery tool: regen only ticks after the
player has gone **4 seconds without taking damage**. Taking a hit
resets the timer (via `_lastDamageAt` which `lifecycle.takeDamage`
already maintains) and pauses regen until the next 4-second window.

The accumulator is also zeroed during the no-regen window so a
returning tick doesn't dump stored progress all at once. Player
still has NO base regen — every HP/s comes from REGEN stacks or
inventory affixes (below). Description updated to clarify the
out-of-combat-only behavior.

### Added — Inventory items roll secondary REGEN affixes

Items generated by `createItem` (helm / armor / shield / plating)
now have a **25% chance** to roll a secondary regen affix on top of
their primary HP / toughness bonus. Affix value scales with item
level:

`+0.25 + (level − 1) × 0.04 HP/s` (L1 = 0.25, L10 = 0.61, L20 = 1.01,
L30 = 1.41).

Stacks across all 4 equipped slots. A late-game inventory full of
regen rolls comes out around 1.5-2 HP/s — meaningful but gated by
the same 4-second no-damage window.

Inventory display shows the affix on the item label:
`+12 MAX HP · +0.6/s REGEN`. `isUpgrade` weights regen 8× so an
item with a regen roll can edge out a slightly higher pure-stat
item.

### Added — `getEffectiveRegen()`

New player method summing REGEN powerup stacks + all equipped-item
`regenBonus` fields. Single source of truth for per-second regen
rate; consumed by the regen tick in `updatePowerups`.

### Changed — Overflow → triforce threshold is now flat 100 HP

`applyHealthOrbToTanks` used to need a full max-HP-worth of overflow
per +1 tank, which scaled the cost up with HEALTH_BOOST stacks.
5.114.0 sets a flat 100-HP threshold per triforce piece. Crisp
number, predictable progress. Bonus: at-max REGEN ticks now also
pay into the same accumulator — camping at full HP slowly builds
toward a new triforce piece.

Shared `accumulateOverflowToTank(credit)` lifecycle helper exported
so any future overflow source (e.g. a +HP powerup pick at max) can
contribute too.

### Added — Sparkling appearance animation for new triforce piece

`spawnTankRecharge` now plays a three-layer effect:

1. **Sparkle burst** — 40 outward motes (was 24), with a rare gold
   accent for visual variety.
2. **Starburst rays** — 8 elongated white sparks shoot straight
   outward in even spokes, reading as a clear "+1 STAR".
3. **Rising halo** — 6 slow upward-drifting motes settle past the
   triforce, making the new piece look like it materialized out of
   falling magic dust.

The bright flash sprite still layers on top for the initial pop.

### Notes — Suggestions for further regen / inventory improvements

Sketched in chat / project notes; deferred so this release stays
focused on the core changes above.

## [5.113.1] - 2026-05-15

### Reverted — Storm Needles back to single-needle + jitter

5.112.0 turned Storm Needles into a 3-needle fan; that wasn't the
intent. Reverted to the original single-needle-per-shot weapon with
per-shot randomized jitter across `spreadAngle` (0.20). Numbers
restored: bulletCount 1, damage 0.4, ~3.08 DPS. MULTI_SHOT and
HAILSTORM still stack additional needles into the cone via the
existing fan-spread path.

### Added — Cone-of-fire visualization on the aim laser

The laser-pointer aim guide (desktop only) now draws a cone wedge
for ANY weapon with `spreadAngle > 0`, not just Scatter Shot. Storm
Needles' 11.5° randomized cone is now visible as a translucent
red-gas wedge with edge lasers and a max-range arc — same visual
language Scatter Shot has used since 5.111.0. The renderer reads
`cfg.spreadAngle` directly so future weapons with spread just need
to set the value in `weapon-data.js`.

Implementation:
- `_drawScatterCone` → renamed to `_drawSpreadCone`. TIGHT_CHOKE
  multiplier removed (retired in 5.111.0); spread now reads
  directly from `cfg.spreadAngle`.
- `drawLaserPointerAim` routes to the cone path when
  `primaryCfg.spreadAngle > 0`, replacing the hardcoded
  `activePrimary === 'SCATTER_GUN'` check.

## [5.113.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed — Auto Power assist now gates ALL mobile power-weapon fire

Pre-5.113.0, mobile auto-fired charge-based power weapons (CHARGE_SHOT)
the moment the charge filled, regardless of the Auto Power assist
toggle. The legacy comment justified it ("a single tap can't represent
press-and-hold-and-release") but that was wrong — the normal
`updateChargingSystem` path already supports tap-to-fire for any
charged shot past `minChargeTime` (3-second floor pre-gates spam).

The unconditional charge auto-fire branch in `player.update` is now
gated behind `assists.autoPower`. Behavior:

- **Auto Power OFF (mobile default):** the player must tap the canvas
  (outside the analog stick + HUD button bar) to fire any power
  weapon. Charge-based weapons require chargeTime ≥ 3s before a tap
  fires; cooldown-based weapons fire immediately on tap if ready.
- **Auto Power ON:** charge-based fires when fully charged AND a
  target is in cone+range. Cooldown-based fires when ready AND a
  target is in cone+range.

Auto Fire and Auto Power are independent toggles (since 5.100.1) —
toggling Auto Fire no longer drags Auto Power along with it on any
platform.

## [5.112.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Storm Needles now fires a cone of 3 needles

Storm Needles was a single-needle weapon with per-shot jitter — a
"cone of fire" in name only. 5.112.0 makes the cone literal: every
shot now fans **3 needles across `spreadAngle`** (11.5°), the same
fan-math Scatter Shot uses. Each needle still has a small ±1.1°
per-shot jitter so consecutive bursts don't trace identical lines.

Damage rebalanced to keep DPS roughly stable at point-blank
saturation:

|                      | before | after  |
|----------------------|-------:|-------:|
| Needles per shot     |     1  |     3  |
| Damage per needle    |   0.4  |   0.15 |
| DPS, all needles hit | 3.08   | 3.46   |
| DPS, 1 needle hits   | 3.08   | 1.15   |

Natural falloff: point-blank lands all three for a saturating
~3.5 DPS; mid-range typically lands 1-2 needles and reads as
chip damage. MULTI_SHOT and HAILSTORM continue to add needles
within the same cone width, so density grows without the cone
spreading visually wider.

Implementation mirrors `fireScatterGun`: even-fan distribution +
per-needle jitter. No new upgrades; no breaking changes to the
existing Storm Needles upgrade tree (NEEDLE_STORM, POISON_TIP,
STATIC_CHARGE, SUPPRESSION, NEEDLE_VELOCITY, HAILSTORM).

## [5.111.0] - 2026-05-15

### Removed — Spread-reduction upgrades

`STEADY_AIM` (Pulse Cannon, -8% spread/stack) and `TIGHT_CHOKE`
(Scatter Shot, -15% spread/stack) are gone. Spread was effectively
dead content on Pulse Cannon (base spread was already 0) and a
crutch on Scatter Shot. Each weapon now ships with the spread it's
meant to have — accuracy is the weapon's identity, not an upgrade
tax.

- **Pulse Cannon**: spread stays 0 (perfectly accurate).
- **Storm Needles**: spread bumped 0.15 → 0.20 (~11.5°) so the cone-
  of-fire identity reads more clearly. Per-shot jitter is still
  randomized so a sustained burst saturates the area in front of
  the ship.
- **Scatter Shot**: spread tightened 0.6 → 0.4 (≈ 34° → 23°). The
  weapon was falling off too hard at distance because pellets
  diverged before reaching the target. Tighter cone keeps the
  shotgun feel close up but lands more pellets at range.
- **Rail Driver**: spread stays 0.

### Changed — Scatter Shot now carries further

Range bumped 1.0 → 1.2 alongside the spread tighten so the pellets
keep momentum to the edge of the screen. The combined effect:
Scatter Shot is no longer just a close-range bully — it's a
credible mid-range option that still rewards point-blank play
through pellet density.

### Added — Replacement upgrades

- `STEADY_AIM` → **DEAD_EYE**: +10% damage AND +3% crit chance per
  stack (max 3). Reinforces Pulse Cannon's "precision" identity
  without leaning on a spread reducer.
- `TIGHT_CHOKE` → **HEAVY_LOAD**: +15% pellet damage per stack
  (max 3). Pure pellet damage so the shotgun build can pursue raw
  punch instead of an aim-tightening kludge that no longer fits
  the weapon's tuned base spread.

## [5.110.0] - 2026-05-15

### Removed — Range-only upgrades + LONG_RANGE powerup

Range as a separate upgrade axis is gone. Base bullet flight covers
the full playfield (since 5.100.3) so range upgrades just stacked
margin past the screen edge — invisible to the player and cluttering
the upgrade trees.

- `PENETRATOR` (Rail Driver, +50% range/stack) → replaced by
  `MASS_DRIVER` ("+25% damage & +20% knockback per stack"). Stacks
  with KINETIC_IMPACT and the KNOCKBACK powerup for kinetic builds.
- `LANCE_VELOCITY` (Lance Beam, "+12% range & damage/stack") → renamed
  "Overcharge Cells", pure +15% damage/stack.
- `TRIPLE_BEAM` (Lance mastery, "+120% damage, +50% width, +50%
  range") → "+150% damage, +50% width". Range part removed; damage
  bumped to compensate.
- `ARC_OVERCHARGE` (Lightning Arc mastery, "+30% damage AND +50%
  chain range") → "+60% arc damage". Chain-range bump dropped; the
  arc is a single-target continuous tether (chain hops retired
  earlier) so the range component had nothing left to multiply.
- `LONG_RANGE` powerup definition deleted from POWERUP_TYPES.
- `RAIL_PENETRATOR_PLUS` capstone prereq retargeted PENETRATOR →
  MASS_DRIVER.
- `getRangeMultiplier()` simplified to `return 1` so per-weapon
  `config.range` modifiers (Rail Driver 0.85, Lance Beam 0.9) are
  the only axis still affecting bullet flight.

### Suggestions for engaging upgrades (deferred — not implemented)

Sketched in the project notes / chat; the deeper "make upgrades
distinct, not numerical" pass is held for a future commit so this
release stays focused on the range-only cleanup.

## [5.109.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Unified + gentled drop magnetism (no more mobile branch)

The mobile-only full-screen magnet was retired across all drop types.
Mobile and desktop now share the same proximity magnet with a
3-tier RANGE HIERARCHY that lets the player commit to a position
to choose what they're scooping:

|              | mid range | snap range | mid str | snap str |
|--------------|----------:|-----------:|--------:|---------:|
| **Gold**     |   180 px  |     60 px  |    6    |   14     |
| **Health**   |   110 px  |     45 px  |    5    |   14     |
| **Inventory**|    90 px  |     40 px  |    4    |   12     |

Gold reaches farthest (it's plentiful and reads as the bread-and-
butter pickup); health and inventory require closer approaches
(higher impact per pickup = more positional commitment).

Strengths cut across the board so the scoop reads as a satisfying
arc instead of a yank. Pre-5.109.0 desktop values (gold 15/25,
health 8/22) were too aggressive once the radii were tightened.

The legacy mobile-only magnets are GONE: `gold-coin.js` /
`gold-shape.js` no longer reference `isMobile()`, and
`stat-pickup.js` (which was mobile-only) now magnets on both
platforms. `drops.js` keeps `DROP_MAGNET_*_MOBILE` exports as
aliases pointing at the desktop values for back-compat with
import sites that may still reference them.

Mobile players still collect — enemies in the turret-defense
loop reliably engage within the magnet's 110-180 px radius, so
drops from those kills naturally come within reach. Tests
updated; 948/948 pass.

## [5.108.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added — Six new powerups

**EXECUTIONER (offensive, 5 stacks @ +20% each)**
Bullets deal +20% per stack to enemies AND asteroids currently below
25% HP. Computed at damage-application time so the bonus naturally
ramps as targets get wounded by sustained fire. Wired into both
asteroid-hit and enemy-hit branches in `collision-system.js`.

**MOMENTUM (offensive, 4 stacks @ +5%/sec each, +15% cap per stack)**
Damage ramps up while the player holds primary fire. `_fireHoldTime`
(ms) ticks up in `player.update` while `input.fire` is true, resets
to 0 on release. `applyGlobalBulletUpgrades` reads it and multiplies
bullet.damage by `1 + stacks × 0.05 × min(3, seconds)`. Linear ramp
peaking at 3 seconds of sustained trigger-hold.

**OVERCHARGE ROUNDS (offensive, 4 stacks)**
Every Nth bullet does 3× damage and renders as a fatter, brighter
"BIG SHOT". Threshold shrinks with stacks (1→every 12 shots,
4→every 5 shots). Per-bullet `bullet.overcharged` flag survives
through `getBulletVisuals` so the overcharged shot reads as a
distinct gold-star projectile. Counter cleared on bullet pool reset
so recycled bullets don't carry the visual.

**GUARDIAN (defensive, 3 stacks)**
Once per wave: a hit that WOULD reduce the player to 0 HP instead
clamps to 1 HP and grants 2s + stacks × 0.5s of invulnerability.
`tryConsumeGuardian()` helper in `combat-manager.js` is called from
every lethal-damage branch (enemy contact, enemy bullet, asteroid
contact) BEFORE the tank-consume / death fallback. Per-wave tracking
via `player._guardianUsedWave === game.currentWave`.

**STATIC DISCHARGE (offensive, 5 stacks)**
Periodic AoE pulse from the ship. Cooldown / radius / damage scale
per stack (1: 4.5s / 90px / 1 → 5: 1.2s / 220px / 3). Hits enemies,
asteroids, AND mines within the radius. Spawns an expanding electric
ring particle for visual confirmation. Driven by `tickStaticDischarge()`
called from the engine update loop after `player.update`.

**WHIRLWIND (offensive, 4 stacks)**
Six teal particles orbit the player at a stack-scaled radius
(1: 80px → 4: 170px); every 333ms, every enemy/asteroid/mine inside
the orbit takes stack-scaled damage (1.0 → 2.5). Visuals spawned
every frame for continuous orbit; damage applies on the discrete
tick. Pairs naturally with close-range builds (Scatter Gun, Charge
Shot). Driven by `tickWhirlwind()` alongside the static discharge.

### Implementation notes

- All six powerups follow the existing `POWERUP_TYPES` shape (DEFENSE
  / OFFENSE category, maxStacks, spCost, gradientColors, icon).
- Per-tick AoE powerups (STATIC_DISCHARGE, WHIRLWIND) early-return
  cheaply when stack count is zero — safe to call unconditionally.
- New helpers exported by `combat-manager.js` and bound on the
  engine: `tryConsumeGuardian`, `tickStaticDischarge`, `tickWhirlwind`.
- 950/950 unit tests pass with the new content.

## [5.107.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added — VAMPIRISM powerup (lifesteal)

Defensive powerup that heals a fraction of damage DEALT back to the
player. Each stack contributes +5%; max 5 stacks → 25% lifesteal at
full investment. Wires into bullet hits on enemies AND asteroids
(both clamped to actual damage applied so overkill doesn't over-heal).
Heal fires a green "+N" floater via the existing 5.106.0 heal-popup
path, aggregated so a sustained barrage reads as one growing number
above the ship.

Implementation: `engine.applyVampirism(damageDealt)` in
`combat-manager.js` — pulls VAMPIRISM stacks off the player, heals
the lifesteal-clamped amount, fires the floater. Call sites in
`collision-system.js` (asteroid hit + enemy hit branches) compute
`hpBefore − hpAfter` and pass that exact amount so over-kill caps.

### Added — THORNS powerup (damage reflection)

Defensive powerup that reflects a fraction of damage TAKEN back at
the source. Each stack contributes +25%; max 4 stacks → 100%
reflection at full investment. Reflects to:

- **Enemy** on contact → `enemy.takeDamage(reflected, { isThorns: true })`
  routes through the normal kill pipeline (flash, streak, etc.)
- **Asteroid** on contact → decrements `asteroid.health` directly
- **Mine** (enemy bullet with health, shape='mine') → decrements
  `mine.health` directly
- **Plain enemy bullet** → no shooter reference exists; falls back
  to damaging the NEAREST active enemy as a proxy "source" so
  thorns still has something to act on

Spawns an orange sparkle burst + a gold damage-number at the
reflection target. Implementation: `engine.applyThorns(damageTaken,
source)` in `combat-manager.js`.

### Suggested follow-up powerups (deferred — not implemented)

Brainstorm in the commit message and project notes; six concepts
sketched in CLAUDE-notes / chat for future passes.

## [5.106.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added — Green "+N" heal popups

Two new floating-number paths, both green, both prefixed with "+", so
the player can SEE healing land:

- **Health pickups** — when a health orb / shape is collected and
  actually restores HP (i.e. the player wasn't already at max),
  `createDamageNumber(player.x, player.y - radius - 4, actualHeal,
  { isHeal: true })` fires a bold green "+N" above the ship.
- **REGEN powerup ticks** — each granted HP fires the same popup,
  aggregated per-player into a single growing number on an 800 ms
  window so a continuous regen reads as "+1 → +2 → +5" instead of
  spamming a new floater every 33 ms.

Renderer (`drawDamageNumbers` in `hud/combat.js`) gets a new branch:
green (70,230,90) bold 18 px, leading "+", same outline + fade
behavior as the red player-hit damage floater so the two read as
clear positive/negative mirrors. Aggregation lives in
`createDamageNumber` keyed on `this._healAggRef` / `_healAggStart`
so the existing per-enemy aggregation isn't disturbed.

## [5.105.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Mobile drops visibly fly to the player

Pre-5.105.0 the mobile magnet forces (FAR=18, NEAR=40 for health;
STRENGTH=32, NEAR=60 for gold; STRENGTH=38, NEAR=70 for stat
pickups) produced ~100+ px/tick steady-state velocity. Drops
teleported to the stationary mobile player instead of flying
visibly — destroying the reward loop. New tuning:

- **Health orbs** (`js/sim/drops.js`): FAR force 18 → 2, NEAR 40 → 6,
  NEAR radius 600 → 200.
- **Gold coins / gold shapes** (`world/gold-coin.js`, `world/gold-shape.js`):
  STRENGTH 32 → 1, NEAR 60 → 4, NEAR_RANGE 200 → 80.
- **Inventory items** (`world/stat-pickup.js`): STRENGTH 38 → 1.2,
  NEAR 70 → 5, NEAR_RANGE 200 → 80.

With friction 0.92, the new forces give v_ss ≈ 25 px/tick at mid-
screen and a satisfying ~0.5–1.0 s visible flight from anywhere on
a phone viewport. The screen-spanning 3000 px radius stays so drops
remain eligible from anywhere; only the per-tick force changes.

### Changed — Enemy destruction screen shake toned down 60%

`triggerEnemyFinalExplosion` was firing `triggerScreenShake(38, 22,
r × 3.0)` per kill — a ~600 ms wobble that compounded into an
unreadable camera when multiple enemies died near each other. Cut
to `triggerScreenShake(14, 8, r × 1.4)`. Hitstop + camera kick +
screen flash are unchanged (those are the load-bearing impact
channels); shake is now a cherry on top instead of dominating the
HUD readability.

### Fixed — Healthbar fill overflow at low HP

When player HP dropped below ~11% of max, the bar's filledWidth
fell below 2 × bevelSize (24 px). The legacy
`createHealthBarPath(filledWidth)` call then produced a
self-intersecting polygon whose top-right control point
(`barX + width − bevelSize × 0.5`) slid LEFT of `barX`, causing
the fill gradient to bleed past the bar's left silhouette.

Fix: clip to the FULL-WIDTH bar silhouette and `fillRect()` inside
the clip. The clip mask preserves the angled bevel corners while
mathematically guaranteeing the fill can't escape the bar's outer
shape. The inner-glow stroke gets the same clip-and-strokeRect
treatment so it also stops tracing past barX. New regression test
`tests/unit/hud/healthbar-low-hp.test.js` (5 tests, all passing)
asserts no draw call writes to an x-coordinate left of `barX = 70`
at 1 / 5 / 11 / 100 HP.

### Fixed — Title-screen version display drifted to 5.100.3

`js/modules/core/version.js` carried `VERSION = '5.100.3'` while
the live build shipped 5.101.0 → 5.102.0 → 5.103.0 → 5.104.0. The
title screen rendered the stale value in its bottom-right build
tag. Synced to 5.105.0 now.

## [5.104.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Killstreak tier labels reordered by epicness

The kill thresholds stay at every 10 (10, 20, …, 200) but the labels
were reshuffled so each tier feels strictly bigger than the last.
The ladder now reads as five distinct narrative bands:

- **Momentum** (10–40): EMPOWERED → RELENTLESS → UNSTOPPABLE → INDOMITABLE
- **Mortal-extraordinary** (50–80): OUTRAGEOUS → HERCULEAN → LEGENDARY → MYTHIC
- **Divine / immortal** (90–120): IMMORTAL → GODLIKE → INVINCIBLE → ETERNAL
- **Cosmic / universe-scale** (130–160): APOCALYPTIC → ASTRONOMICAL → GALACTIC → COSMIC
- **Beyond physical** (170–200): TRANSCENDENT → OMNIPOTENT → INFINITE → RAINBOIDS GOD

LEGENDARY moved from 50 → 70 kills as part of the reorder; the
auto-explosive-splash gate still keys on LEGENDARY by name, so the
splash bonus now unlocks at 70 kills instead of 50 (still carries
through every tier above to RAINBOIDS GOD).

Each label keeps its original color so the visual fingerprint of
LEGENDARY (gold), HERCULEAN (lime), COSMIC (purple), etc. persists.
Damage multipliers stay on the +0.15-per-tier → taper → 3.00× cap
curve from 5.103.0.

## [5.103.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Killstreak ladder rescaled to every-10-kills, 20 tiers

The streak system now fires a phase change every 10 confirmed kills,
covering all the way to 200 with twenty distinct labels:

10 EMPOWERED · 20 UNSTOPPABLE · 30 RELENTLESS · 40 GODLIKE ·
50 LEGENDARY · 60 HERCULEAN · 70 INDOMITABLE · 80 OUTRAGEOUS ·
90 IMMORTAL · 100 APOCALYPTIC · 110 ASTRONOMICAL · 120 GALACTIC ·
130 COSMIC · 140 TRANSCENDENT · 150 OMNIPOTENT · 160 MYTHIC ·
170 INVINCIBLE · 180 ETERNAL · 190 INFINITE · 200 RAINBOIDS GOD.

Damage multipliers climb in +0.15 steps through LEGENDARY (50 kills,
1.85×) then taper into the high tiers — wave 200 lands at the 3.00×
hard cap. Each tier carries its own color so the streak HUD reads as
a distinct ramp rather than "everything is gold past the first peak".

### Changed — Auto-explosive splash unlocks at LEGENDARY (50)

The auto-splash bullet bonus that fired at LEGENDARY (15) in 5.102.0
now triggers at the new LEGENDARY (50 kills) and every tier above —
sixteen tiers in total. A bigger lift to earn, but it carries all the
way through to the RAINBOIDS GOD cap.

## [5.102.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added — Epic 13-tier killstreak ladder

The streak system now covers all the way to 200 kills with thirteen
distinct labels (each in its own color so the streak HUD reads as a
phase change, not a generic gold flash):

3 EMPOWERED · 6 UNSTOPPABLE · 10 GODLIKE · 15 LEGENDARY · 20 HERCULEAN ·
30 INDOMITABLE · 45 OUTRAGEOUS · 60 IMMORTAL · 80 APOCALYPTIC · 100
ASTRONOMICAL · 130 TRANSCENDENT · 165 ETERNAL · 200 RAINBOIDS GOD.

Damage multipliers climb in +0.20–0.25 steps to LEGENDARY (2.00×) and
then flatten to ~0.10 / 0.05 / 0.025 per tier — the high tiers are
*cosmetic* flexes; the 200-kill cap stays at 3.00× so balance doesn't
break. The auto-explosive-splash bonus that used to kick in only at
LEGENDARY now triggers at LEGENDARY and every tier above it.

### Changed — Health orbs slower magnet, permanent on field

- Magnet radii tightened from 320 → **140 px** (far) and 120 → **55 px**
  (near). Player still scoops orbs on a flyby but has to commit to the
  position; the old wide pull made health pickups feel trivial.
- Health drops are now PERMANENT. The 7200-tick lifetime decrement is
  skipped for `kind === 'health'` so orbs sit on the field forever
  until collected. Opacity stays pinned at 1.0 (no fade-out tail).

### Added — Shiny health-orb rendering

Three new visual layers in `_drawHealthShapesCanvas2D` (canvas-2D path,
runs for the `is3DShape` orbs):

1. Outer pink-blue radial glow with pulsing radius keyed off the
   twinkle wave.
2. Sparkle ring — four small twinkle motes orbiting at radius ~1.45 r,
   rotating with the orb.
3. Top-left specular highlight clipped to the orb silhouette so the
   sphere reads as polished / "wet".

Result: health orbs pop off bright nebulae and combat FX instead of
blending in.

### Added — 13-tier streak HUD now drives splash AoE

The `streakTierLabel === 'LEGENDARY'` check in `player/weapons.js` that
forced explosive splash on every shot now matches the LEGENDARY and
nine higher tiers, so the splash perk holds all the way to RAINBOIDS
GOD.

### Changed — Stats overlay slimmed dramatically

- VITALS: trimmed to Max HP + Damage Reduction (Shield Tanks + Lives
  rows dropped — already shown by HUD chrome).
- OFFENSE: dropped Primary/Power name rows (HUD loadout squares own
  this), dropped Range Mult (always 1.0 post-5.100.3) and Knockback
  (not a number the player references). Tooltip text on remaining
  rows trimmed to one short line.
- ECONOMY: collapsed to Gold Find only. The four per-level drop
  scaling rows were dev-flavored and never informed a decision.
- WORLD SCALING section removed entirely.
- INVENTORY: each slot now shows `Lx +N TYPE` on one line; the
  multi-line tip block is gone. Empty slots show `—`.
- POWERUPS HELD: hidden when none are held (no `— none —` row);
  tip text reduced to a single line.

### Changed — Mobile ASSISTS tab only exposes AUTO POWER

On mobile, Aim Assist / Auto Aim / Auto Fire are baked into the
tap-to-shoot input — the press-and-hold handler routes to a snapped
target and fires while held. The three toggles can't actually be
turned off, so they're now hidden from the ASSISTS tab. AUTO POWER
stays user-controllable. Desktop keeps the full set.

`_loadAssists()` force-merges `{ aimAssist: true, autoAim: true,
autoFire: true }` on mobile regardless of localStorage so an older
save can't carry forward a `false` value the player can't see or
change.

### Changed — index.html fully stubbed; static-dom is the SSOT

Every HUD/overlay element in `index.html` is now an empty stub.
`static-dom.js::buildStaticDom()` builds the children at boot, BEFORE
any module looks up DOM ids. New builders:

- `_buildLivesDisplay()` — triforce default content
- `_buildHudShopBtn()` — 🛒 emoji + aria
- `_buildHudPauseBtn()` — two `.hud-pause-bar` spans
- `_buildCustomizationOverlay()` — Control Layout header + save button
- `_buildHintOverlay()` — `.hint-text` child

Removes the flash-of-stale-content that the legacy ASSISTS markup
caused on first paint (previously rendered the desktop rows for a
frame before being replaced with the mobile-trimmed set).

## [5.101.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Defensive skill system retired

The defensive skill system (BULWARK / REPAIR_NANITES / DEFLECTOR_ORBS /
EMP_PULSE / TRACTOR_SHIELD) and its HUD chrome are commented out. The
game is now primary + power weapons only on the loadout. Defensive
progression flows through three channels instead:

- Defensive powerups restored to `POWERUP_TYPES` (HEALTH_BOOST,
  SHIELD_BOOST as "Toughness", and a new REGEN passive `+0.5 HP/s`
  per stack). All three appear in the pause-menu POWERUPS tab and
  in the survivor-card pool.
- Diablo-style inventory (helm/armor/shield/plating) now drops on
  desktop too — was mobile-only.
- HEALTH_BOOST now grants a full heal on pick (was `+25 HP`).

HUD: the third loadout square (SKILL), the REFLEXES / LAST_STAND /
STATIC_FIELD widget cluster, the SKILLS pause-menu tab, the R-key
radial menu, and the Q-key skill-activate are all commented out (not
deleted) so the system can be resurrected verbatim if needed.

### Added — Survivor cards on desktop with 2 + 1 balance

The wave-clear powerup pick (formerly mobile-only) now fires on
desktop too. The pick offers **2 offensive + 1 defensive** cards
every time, drawn from the new POWERUP_TYPES categories. Picks are
free (no SP cost) and route through the same overlay both platforms
already used.

### Added — Shop-suggest overlay after each pick

After claiming a survivor card the player sees a 3-card "QUICK BUY"
overlay listing weapon upgrades tailored to the equipped primary +
power weapon (filtered by ownership, prereq gates, and current
gold). Click to buy; the overlay re-renders so the player can chain
buys, then CONTINUE skips into the next wave.

### Changed — 30-wave campaign with survivor cards every 3rd wave

`MAX_WAVES` bumped 20 → 30. Each wave gains a sub-wave so the run
is roughly 50% longer wave-to-wave. Survivor cards now fire only on
waves divisible by 3 (waves 3 / 6 / 9 / … / 30) for a total of 10
free picks per playthrough. Off-cadence waves slide straight into
the next wave without an interruption; players can still spend SP
on the pause-menu POWERUPS tab any time. New WAVE_DATA / boss
tier 5 / waves 21-30 / wave subtitles added. Enemy level / speed
formulas re-keyed so the stat curve clamps at the previous L20
ceiling instead of compounding into wave 30.

### Changed — Enemies no longer scale in visual size

The `1 + (level − 1) × 0.13` size multiplier in `enemy.js` was
making late-wave enemies dominate the screen visually. Removed:
silhouette stays at base size at every wave; HP / damage / speed
scaling unchanged.

### Changed — Reduced screen shake from explosive bullets

EXPLOSIVE-flagged bullets no longer fire the per-hit screen shake
on enemies, and their asteroid-destruction shake is halved (mag +
duration). The cumulative wobble from spread-pellet EXPLOSIVE
builds is gone; the explosion particle effect alone carries the
impact read.

### Changed — Heart icon in HP readout pops

The cached `heart` sprite now paints a coral-to-crimson body
gradient with an outer pink glow and a top-left specular highlight
clipped to the silhouette. Replaces the hollow `#800000` fill that
read as a flat outline.

## [5.100.3] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — Default bullet range covers the full screen

Pre-5.100.3 base bullet flight was ~480 px (~24% of the 1920-wide
game field). The LONG_RANGE powerup added +55% per stack, requiring
~4 stacks to reach the screen edge — every player essentially had to
invest in LONG_RANGE before any other offense felt rewarding.

5.100.3 bumps the base bullet lifetime so primary shots reach the
edge of the playfield (1920 px) by default. The per-weapon
`config.range` modifier in `weapon-data.js` still scales relative to
this new baseline so Rail Driver (0.85) and Lance Beam (0.9) keep
their relative reach.

Auto-fire range check (player.js auto-fire block) bumped from base
400 px to 2000 px so the AI auto-fire trigger reaches as far as the
new bullet flight.

### Removed — LONG_RANGE powerup retired

With shots reaching screen edge by default, LONG_RANGE is redundant.
The config entry stays in `POWERUP_TYPES` (marked `hidden: true`) so
existing saves with LONG_RANGE stacks still load — the extra range
just adds margin past the screen edge, harmless. Filtered out of:

- The pause-menu Powerups tab (no longer appears in the buy list).
- The mobile wave-pick 3-card overlay (selection pool skips hidden).
- The stats overlay's Range Mult tooltip (no longer references the
  retired stack count).

### Changed — Shop HELP page mobile font scale-down

The HELP tab's gold / SP / XP explainer blurbs used Press Start 2P at
13-16 px which overflowed phone viewports. Added `body.mobile-mode`
and `body.mobile-portrait` overrides: title 16 → 12 → 10 px, body
12 → 10 → 9 px, intro 13 → 10 → 9 px, plus tighter padding and
smaller currency badges. Desktop is unchanged.

### Files

- `js/modules/player/bullet.js`: `maxLife` bumped 30 → 240 (×
  TICK_SCALE).
- `js/modules/player/player.js`: auto-fire base range 400 → 2000.
- `js/modules/world/powerup.js`: `LONG_RANGE` marked `hidden: true`.
- `js/modules/ui/ui-manager.js`: filter `hidden` from the Powerups
  list.
- `js/modules/wave/wave-manager.js`: filter `hidden` from the wave-
  pick selection pool.
- `js/modules/ui/stats-overlay.js`: Range Mult tooltip no longer
  references LONG_RANGE.
- `css/styles.css`: mobile shop-help scale-down rules.

944/944 unit tests passing.

## [5.100.2] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — All UI overlays generated by JavaScript (no FOUC)

The pause overlay (actions row + tabs + every tab's static markup),
the wave-pick overlay (title + subtitle + cards container), the shop
overlay (close button + currency row + tab strip + items list), and
the stats overlay (panel header + body + tooltip + footer) used to
ship as hardcoded HTML in `index.html`. JS modules then re-rendered
the dynamic parts on tab switch — which produced flash-of-stale-
content on first open because the static HTML and the JS render
could drift.

5.100.2 centralizes every previously-static block into a single
`js/modules/ui/static-dom.js` module that's called from `main.js`
BEFORE any UIManager / StatsOverlay constructor walks the DOM. Now:

- `index.html` ships pure stubs (`<div id="stats-overlay"></div>`,
  `<div id="pause-overlay"></div>`, etc.). No content to drift.
- `buildStaticDom()` runs first thing after the desktop-only check
  and populates every container with the markup the UI modules
  expect. Idempotent via a `data-built-dom` sentinel.
- DOM lookups in UIManager (music-play-pause, sfx-volume-slider,
  assist-aim-assist, etc.) and StatsOverlay (stats-panel-title,
  stats-summary, etc.) still resolve cleanly because the markup
  exists by the time the constructors run.

This is purely a refactor — no behavior change. The big win is no
more flash-of-static-content on first overlay open, and JS is now
the single source of truth for the layout (no risk of label/markup
drift between HTML and JS).

### Changed — Wavy text scaled down on mobile across ALL surfaces

The 5.97 mobile responsive pass shrank the title screen, game over,
wave intro, and game complete wavy text. 5.100.2 finishes the sweep
for the remaining wavy-text surfaces:

- **WAVE COMPLETE notification** (title 48 → 28 px portrait / 36 px
  landscape; subtitle 24 → 15 px portrait). Lifted topY closer to
  the top of screen so the message fits between the HUD chrome and
  the playfield.
- **LEVEL UP toast** (LEVEL N! 32 → 20 px portrait; Skill Point
  Gained! 16 → 11 px portrait).
- **Powerup pickup label** (32 → 18 px portrait; description 14 → 9
  px portrait).

Desktop sizes unchanged.

### Files

- `js/modules/ui/static-dom.js` (new): centralized DOM builder for
  every previously-static overlay block.
- `js/main.js`: invokes `buildStaticDom()` before setupManagers().
- `index.html`: replaced ~180 lines of static UI markup with 4
  empty stubs.
- `js/modules/hud/status.js`: WAVE COMPLETE + LEVEL UP wavy text
  responsive on mobile.
- `js/modules/hud/combat.js`: powerup pickup label + description
  responsive on mobile.

944/944 unit tests passing.

## [5.100.1] - 2026-05-15

### Removed — Mobile reticle

The screen-space reticle that followed `_mobileLastTouchCanvasX/Y` (or
`input.screenAimX/Y` as fallback) is disabled on mobile. In the 5.100
drag-to-move + auto-aim model the player never aims manually, so the
crosshair just followed the auto-aim target and felt distracting.

### Fixed — Power weapon was auto-firing on mobile (Model F broken)

5.100.0 set `assists.autoFire = true` for mobile, which routed through
the player.js auto-fire block and pulsed `input.fireSecondary` too —
so cooldown power weapons fired automatically the moment they were
ready, defeating the tap-for-power Model F overlay.

Split the gate: `autoFire` now controls PRIMARY only;
`autoPower` is a new separate assist that controls the power weapon.
Mobile defaults to `autoFire: true, autoPower: false` — tap-for-power
works as intended; players who want full auto can opt in.

### Added — Auto Power assist

New checkbox in the pause-menu Assists tab. When enabled, the power
weapon fires automatically the moment it's off cooldown (cooldown
weapons) or fully charged (CHARGE_SHOT). Disabled by default so the
mobile tap-for-power loop stays player-driven. Persists via the
existing `rainboidsAssists` localStorage key.

### Added — Mobile-specific Controls tab

The pause-menu CONTROLS tab now renders a wholly different page on
mobile devices that documents the 5.100 stick + tap-for-power model:

  Movement   🎮  Drag the analog stick at the bottom corner
  Aim       🎯  AUTO — locks onto nearest target
  Fire       🔫  AUTO — holds while a target is in range
  Power     ⚡  TAP anywhere outside the stick
  System    ⏸  Bottom HUD buttons; swap weapons via pause menu
  Tips      ↔  Toggle stick side, enable AUTO POWER, etc.

Desktop keeps the existing WASD + mouse + key-sprite renderer.

### Changed — Pre-render every pause tab to avoid first-open flash

The Skills tab and Timer tab were not pre-rendered at boot; opening
them for the first time showed an empty container for one frame before
the dynamic renderer filled it in. Added both to the boot pre-render
list alongside Controls / Primary / Power / Powerups / Assists. Every
pause tab is now populated before the first time the pause menu can
be opened.

### Files

- `js/modules/game-engine.js`: `_loadAssists` default + reticle draw
  call retired.
- `js/modules/player/player.js`: split auto-fire gate, mobile
  defaults `autoPower=false` (mergeable with stored prefs).
- `js/modules/ui/ui-manager.js`: mobile Controls renderer
  (`_renderMobileControlsTab`); autoPower wiring; pre-render Skills
  + Timer at boot.
- `index.html`: new `#assist-auto-power` checkbox.
- `css/styles.css`: `.controls-mobile-chip` styling for the new
  mobile Controls page.

944/944 unit tests passing.

## [5.100.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added — Mobile: virtual analog stick + Sky-force-style controls (Model A + F)

Mobile gameplay pivots from the 5.94/5.97 press-and-hold-to-aim model
to the Sky-force / Galaxy-Attack template players already know:

- **Virtual analog stick** at a bottom corner (configurable LEFT or
  RIGHT for handedness). Drag the handle inside the base to drive
  ship velocity. Released stick = ship decelerates and stops.
- **Auto-aim** picks the nearest target every frame.
- **Auto-fire primary** holds the primary weapon while alive.
- **Tap anywhere not on the stick or HUD** → fires the equipped
  **power weapon** (Model F overlay — preserves the only meaningful
  decision-point that pure auto-fire would flatten).
- **CHARGE_SHOT** still auto-fires on full charge because a single
  tap can't represent the press-and-hold-and-release gesture.

The player no longer aims manually on mobile. The whole input loop
is "drive the ship to dodge."

### Changed — Camera zoom + assist gates

- Portrait camera zoom 0.65 → **0.78**; landscape 0.8 → **0.88**. A
  moving ship needs more world visible than a stationary one; the
  pre-5.100 values were tuned for the parked-camera model.
- 5.95.1's "mobile force-disables all assists" patch is REVERSED.
  Player.update now builds a mobile-specific assists block with
  `autoAim: true, autoFire: true` so the AI handles aiming and firing
  while the player drives the stick.
- 5.92's "mobile auto-fires ALL power weapons" path is NARROWED to
  CHARGE-based weapons only. Cooldown weapons fire via the tap
  pulse from mobile-touch.js.

### Removed — PRM/PWR side buttons on mobile

The 5.99.3 PRM/PWR side buttons at bottom corners are dropped on
mobile to free the corner for the stick. Weapon swap moves to the
pause menu's PRIMARY / POWER tabs — not action-critical when
auto-fire and auto-aim handle the moment-to-moment combat. Desktop
is unaffected (PRM/PWR were always mobile-only).

### Stick side preference

The stick defaults to bottom-LEFT (right-handed thumb). A
`localStorage` key `rainboids:mobile-stick-side` persists the
preference across sessions. Engine method `flipAnalogStickSide()`
toggles between LEFT and RIGHT; UI hook (pause-menu toggle) is a
follow-up.

### Files

- `js/modules/ui/analog-stick.js` (new): `AnalogStick` class with
  base/handle render + touch state machine.
- `js/modules/game-engine.js`: instantiates the stick, persists
  side preference, draws it in the HUD pass, exposes
  `flipAnalogStickSide()`.
- `js/modules/ui/event-setup.js`: re-anchors the stick on every
  resize / orientationchange.
- `js/modules/ui/mobile-touch.js`: rewritten for the new contract —
  classifies each touch as HUD / radial / stick / tap-for-power.
- `js/modules/player/player.js`: drops the 5.94 velocity-zero patch,
  drives ship velocity from `input.stickInput`, clamps to the game
  field. Re-enables mobile assists. Narrows mobile auto-fire to
  CHARGE-based power weapons only.
- `js/modules/hud/hud-buttons.js`: drops PRM/PWR side rects on
  mobile.
- `js/modules/hud/status.js`: invokes `analogStick.draw()` after
  the canvas HUD buttons.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/ui/mobile-touch.test.js`: full rewrite for the stick +
  tap-for-power contract. Old 5.97 press-and-hold tests removed.
- `tests/unit/player/mobile-stationary.test.js`: rewrote to pin the
  new drag-to-move model.
- `tests/unit/player/mobile-auto-fire.test.js`: rewrote to pin the
  narrowed mobile auto-fire (CHARGE-only).
- `tests/unit/player/mobile-assists-disabled.test.js`: rewrote to
  pin the re-enabled mobile assists.
- `tests/unit/hud/hud-buttons.test.js`: updated for PRM/PWR removal.

944/944 unit tests passing.

### Migration note for players

The Classic Aim model (5.94-5.99.x: press-and-hold to aim) is hard-
switched out. No in-game toggle in 5.100.0; if the community asks for
it, a settings option can come in 5.100.x.

## [5.99.4] - 2026-05-14

### Added — Diablo-style defensive item system

Replaces the flat `+5 MAX HP` / `+3% DEFENSE` pickups from 5.98 with
a slot-based item system. Four equipment slots:

  HP slots:        helm,  armor
  Toughness slots: shield, plating

Each pickup carries:
  - A SLOT (assigned at spawn time — one HP roll picks helm OR armor,
    one toughness roll picks shield OR plating)
  - A LEVEL = the current wave number
  - A randomly-generated NAME from the template
    `[Prefix] [Base] of [Suffix]`. Prefix/suffix pools are tone-typed
    (HP: Sturdy/Hardened/of the Bear/of Endurance; Toughness:
    Bristling/Tempered/of Iron/of the Tortoise). Bases are per-slot
    so the language stays believable ("Sturdy Helm of the Bear",
    "Bristling Bracers of Iron"). Combinatorics: **1152 possible
    distinct names** across all four slots.
  - A scaled bonus value:
      HP:        `5 + (level - 1) × 2`         L1=5, L10=23, L20=43
      Toughness: `3 + (level - 1) × 0.4`       L1=3, L10=6.6, L20=10.6

**Replacement logic:** on pickup, the new item's bonus is compared to
the currently-equipped item in that slot. If higher, it replaces;
otherwise the item is discarded with a "NO UPGRADE" toast so the
player understands why nothing happened. HP items also bump current
HP by the bonus delta on equip so the wider bar isn't empty.

**Bonus aggregation:** extends `getEffectiveMaxHealth` and
`getEffectiveShield` in `progression.js`. HP items stack on top of
HEALTH_BOOST powerup stacks; toughness items stack on top of
SHIELD_BOOST. The existing 600 HP and 75% shield caps still hold.

**Inventory display:** new INVENTORY (DEFENSE) section in the stats
overlay (open with the STATS HUD button or backtick key on desktop).
Shows all 4 slots with the equipped item's name, level, and bonus.
Empty slots labeled `— none —`. Each row has a tooltip explaining the
slot.

**Pickup feedback:** the canvas toast (added 5.99.2) shows the item's
random name + slot + bonus. Example: "Sturdy Helm of the Bear /
HELM · +13 MAX HP".

### Files

- `js/modules/world/item-names.js` — prefix/base/suffix tables
  (committed in 5.99.3 as data-only; now consumed by the runtime).
- `js/modules/world/item-system.js` — new file: `createItem(slot,
  level)`, `getHpBonusForLevel`, `getToughnessBonusForLevel`,
  `isUpgrade`.
- `js/modules/player/player.js` — `equippedItems` table +
  `equipItem(item)` replace-if-better.
- `js/modules/player/progression.js` — extended bonus aggregation.
- `js/modules/world/stat-pickup.js` — accepts slot + level.
- `js/modules/combat/combat-manager.js` — drop spawn picks a specific
  slot per roll.
- `js/modules/combat/collision-system.js` — on pickup, generate item,
  call player.equipItem, route toast.
- `js/modules/ui/stats-overlay.js` — INVENTORY section.

Full unit suite 972/972 passing.

## [5.99.3] - 2026-05-14

### Changed — Mobile HUD: PRM/PWR side buttons moved to bottom corners

Pre-5.99.3 the PRM and PWR weapon-swap buttons sat vertically centred
on the left and right edges of the canvas. They blocked aim taps on
the edges and collected accidental drags during continuous-fire
gestures. Moved to the bottom-LEFT and bottom-RIGHT corners, sharing
the same baseline as the central SHOP/STATS/PAUSE row. The bottom of
the screen now reads as one HUD row: `[PRM] [SHOP STATS PAUSE] [PWR]`.

Mobile button widths shrunk slightly so all 5 buttons fit a 360-wide
phone (central 72→56 wide, side 64→60). Test
`tests/unit/hud/hud-buttons.test.js` updated to pin the new
bottom-corner layout.

### Changed — Mobile killstreak: simple transparent number

Pre-5.99.3 mobile inherited the desktop killstreak indicator which
rendered "N KILLS" big number + tier label + two progress bars + idle
countdown — about 110 px of vertical screen real estate, glowy, and
opaque enough to hide enemies behind it. Replaced on mobile with a
single transparent `36 px` number rendered at low opacity (32% idle,
55% when streak buff is active) at the top-center. No glow, no
shadow, no tier labels, no bars. Player can see enemies through it.

Desktop is unchanged.

### Changed — Mobile: constant background + nebula motion in all states

Pre-5.99.3 the mobile starfield drift only ran in PLAYING /
WAVE_TRANSITION; PAUSED / SHOP / GAME_OVER froze the background. Plus
the nebula didn't drift in-game on mobile — only on the title screen.

Now ALL non-title-screen mobile states feed a synthetic sum-of-sines
drift into:
- The Canvas2D BackgroundStar pool
- The WebGL starfield renderer (`accumulateDrift`)
- The nebula renderer (`_titleNebulaDriftX/Y` + `_titleNebulaRotation`)

Drift amplitude bumped ~25% vs the 5.97 mobile tuning so the
background reads as constantly evolving instead of "barely moving."
Extracted into two helpers on the engine: `_mobileBackgroundDrift()`
and `_accumulateMobileNebulaDrift(drift)` so the formula lives in one
place.

### Changed — Mobile: 1-2 enemies per subwave cap

The per-wave multiplier (5.99.1/2) already thinned counts, but a
sub-wave entry list like `[GUARDIAN 2, SENTINEL 2, STALKER 3]` still
dumped 6 enemies into the field per sub-wave after scaling.

Added a per-entry cap on mobile:
- Wave 1-2: max 1 enemy per entry
- Wave 3-4: max 2
- Wave 5+: max 2

So a sub-wave with 4 entries gives at most 4-8 simultaneous enemies
on mobile (used to be 8-16). The casual touch-controls pitch finally
lands.

### Note

The Diablo-style item system (random names, slot-based gear,
inventory display in stats overlay) groundwork started in 5.99.3:
`js/modules/world/item-names.js` is committed with the name/base/slot
tables. The runtime system that consumes those tables is deferred —
this release focuses on the mobile UX wins the user asked for.

---

## [5.99.2] - 2026-05-14

### Changed — Crit damage no longer flashes the screen (ALL platforms)

The pre-5.99.2 crit damage renderer grew the font from 22 → 56 px over
the lifetime of the floater and added a 14-34 px white-hot shadow
glow. On small viewports — and even on a 27" monitor at high crit
rates — this read as a sustained full-screen flash. Could hurt
readability and was hostile to photosensitive players.

Crits now render at a fixed 22 px size with a "CRIT!" tag in
yellow above the orange damage number. Still clearly distinguishable
from non-crit hits (orange vs gold, larger font, tag), but no zoom or
glow burst.

### Changed — Steeper early-wave reduction on mobile

The 5.99.1 flat 0.45 multiplier still made waves 1-3 feel frenetic
because each sub-wave dumps multiple enemy types at once. New
per-wave table for mobile:

  Wave 1: 0.20× enemies / 0.25× asteroids
  Wave 2: 0.25× / 0.25×
  Wave 3: 0.30× / 0.25×
  Wave 4: 0.40× / 0.35×
  Wave 5+: 0.45× / 0.40× (5.99.1 tuning preserved)

Bosses still spawn at full count.

### Changed — Mobile stat pickup frequency 3× and visibility +50%

The 5.98.0 stat-pickup drop rates (HP_UP 0.8% / TOUGHNESS 0.6%, boss
2.4 / 1.8) produced a permanent-upgrade roughly every 3-4 waves on
mobile. 5.99.2 bumps to ~2.5% / 2.0% (boss 6% / 5%) so the player
sees one roughly every wave. Pickup visual radius bumped 14 → 20 px
so drops don't get lost in combat (also widens the auto-collect
window since collision reads `this.radius`).

### Fixed — Pickup feedback was silently dropped

CRITICAL: `ui-manager.showMessage()` is a no-op because
`#game-message-overlay` is commented out in `index.html`. Every
`ui:show-message` event — including the stat-pickup "HP UP / +5 MAX
HEALTH" confirmation added in 5.98.0 — was silently dropped. Players
were getting permanent stat boosts with zero feedback.

5.99.2 adds a new canvas-rendered toast (`drawPickupToast` +
`triggerPickupToast` on the engine). Small bottom-anchored pill with
the pickup name and bonus, fades in over 120 ms and out across the
last 30% of its lifetime. Stat-pickup collision now calls
`triggerPickupToast` instead of the dead `ui:show-message` path.

Future work: audit the other `ui:show-message` call sites
(mission complete, last-stand save, etc.) and route them through the
new toast or re-enable `#game-message-overlay`.

---

## [5.99.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed — Mobile difficulty: 55% fewer enemies, 60% fewer asteroids

Mobile waves felt overwhelming compared to the casual touch-controls
pitch. `getWaveConfig` now applies per-group scaling on mobile only:

- Non-boss enemy counts × 0.45 (rounded, 1-floor per group)
- Asteroid counts × 0.40 (1-floor)
- Boss enemies kept at full count (so the 5/10/15/20 milestones still
  feel like milestones)

Net effect by sample wave (mobile only):
  - Wave 1: 7 enemies → 3 enemies, 4 asteroids → 2
  - Wave 13 (was 14 enemies / 3 asteroids): 8 enemies / 1 asteroid
  - Wave 20 (final boss): bosses preserved, escort thinned ~half

Implemented via a tiny wave-scaling helper + a per-wave cache so
subsequent reads are no-cost. Desktop is untouched (verified against
the unscaled paths in tests/unit/wave.test.js — all green).

### Fixed — Survival record text overflows on phone viewports

The title-screen "Survival Record: X hours, Y minutes, Z seconds"
line ran off the canvas on narrow phones, and the font was still ~14
px portrait / 16 px desktop on mobile. Fixed:

- On mobile, render `RECORD HH:MM:SS` (or `RECORD M:SS` for sub-hour
  runs) instead of the verbose phrase.
- Font caps cut: portrait ≤ 10 px (was 14), landscape ≤ 12 px (was
  16). Desktop unchanged at 16 px.
- The `recordH` layout reservation shrinks proportionally on mobile so
  the title-block centering math doesn't leave a phantom gap.

---

## [5.99.0] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed — Mobile pause stays paused after closing the menu

The pause overlay refused to release on mobile: tap pause, tap resume,
overlay hides but the game stayed frozen. Two compounding bugs:

1. The canvas `click` listener in `event-setup.js` was still firing on
   mobile alongside the dedicated `mobile-touch.js` touchend handler.
   iOS Safari synthesizes a `click` after `touchend` even when
   `touchstart` calls `preventDefault()`, so a single tap on the HUD
   PAUSE button was firing `togglePause()` twice — visually it looked
   like nothing happened. Added `if (isMobile()) return;` at the top
   of the canvas click handler so mobile-touch.js owns the surface.
2. When the wave-pick overlay opened on top of an already-paused
   game (player paused during the 2.7s gap before wave-clear), picking
   a card hid wave-pick but left the pause overlay's `display: 'flex'`
   inline style. The next Resume tap took the player BACK to PAUSED
   because the toggle assumed the overlay was already showing AND
   togglePause's `style.display === 'flex'` round-trip logic was
   fragile. Made `togglePause` set `style.display` explicitly (no
   toggle), and made `closeWavePickOverlay` defensively hide the
   pause overlay too.

### Changed — Enemy AI: shoot + weave (no more kamikaze divebombing)

The 5.95.x "fruit-ninja kamikaze" rules retired. Mobile enemies now
behave like classic shmup enemies:

- They **shoot** (the `decideEnemyShooting` + `updateShooting` mobile
  short-circuits are removed; same firing pipeline as desktop).
- They **weave** laterally — a per-tick sin-phased side-step
  perpendicular to the player-line. Each enemy carries a unique
  `_weavePhase` so the field doesn't pulse in lockstep.
- They **dodge** active player bullets (existing `dodgePlayerBullets`
  already runs every tick — now with player bullets actually flying
  their way, the swerve reads as intentional evasion).
- Bosses still exempt; their tier-3+ formation-orbit AI takes priority.

### Fixed — Wavy text now centers correctly

`drawWavyText` (the title-screen and game-over wavy renderer) had a
half-glyph-width centering bug: with `textAlign='center'` and rendering
glyph-by-glyph at `currentX` (the cumulative left-edge cursor), every
glyph's center landed at currentX — shifting the whole text block left
by ~glyphWidth/2 of the first character. The title screen had a manual
`centerX + 10` workaround that broke on different font sizes and on
mobile. Fixed by placing each glyph's center at
`currentX + glyphWidth/2` instead. RAINBOIDS and GAME OVER are now
perfectly centered in portrait AND landscape (and on desktop).

### Changed — Shop: gold-only currency display, weapon-colored buttons

- The shop currency row no longer shows SP or "+SP" picks badges — only
  the gold readout. SP is exclusively for the pause-menu Powerups tab
  per the 5.98 SP-economy split, so showing SP in the shop was
  misleading. Hidden via inline `style="display: none"`.
- Every per-weapon tab (PULSE / NEEDLES / SCATTER / RAIL / CHARGE /
  MINES / NOVA / MISSILES / LANCE / ARC) and every upgrade row inside
  is now tinted with that weapon's canonical color, via new
  `.shop-tab[data-tab="X"]` and `.shop-item--weaponed` CSS rules and a
  `--item-color` CSS var set by `shop-dom.js::shopItemAccentColor`.
- Weapon colors that overlapped (`STORM_NEEDLES` and `PULSE_CANNON`
  were both cyan; `CHARGE_SHOT` matched; `LIGHTNING_ARC` collided with
  the EMP skill) are now distinct:
    - `STORM_NEEDLES`: `#88ffff` → `#b3ff44` (chartreuse)
    - `CHARGE_SHOT`:   `#00ffff` → `#00e6aa` (teal-aqua)
    - `MINE_LAYER`:    `#ff6600` → `#ff3300` (crimson-orange)
    - `LIGHTNING_ARC`: `#8888ff` → `#a855ff` (electric purple)

### Changed — Mobile shop text scaled down

The 5.79.57 ten-tab strip in the shop didn't fit a phone viewport at
the desktop 18 px Press Start 2P. Cut tab font to 10 px on mobile and
9 px on portrait phones, with proportional padding / gap reductions.
Shop title and item rows scale to match (22 → 18 px title,
icon column 56 → 40 px, body fonts 16 → 11 px portrait).

### Tests

`tests/unit/sim/mobile-enemy.test.js` rewritten to pin the new contract
(enemies fire, lateral weave instead of kamikaze pull, bosses still
exempt). `tests/unit/enemy/mobile-wrapper-fire-suppression.test.js`
inverted to assert that the legacy wrapper path now ALSO permits firing
on mobile. Full unit suite 972/972 passing.

---

## [5.98.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added — Mobile: 3-card random powerup pick on wave clear

The mobile wave-clear reward is no longer "+1 SP to spend in a menu" —
it's a full-screen `#wave-pick-overlay` showing **3 random non-maxed
powerup cards**. Tap one to claim a free stack and resume into the next
wave. Picks are drawn from the master `POWERUP_TYPES` catalog and
filtered against `maxStacks` so the player never sees an unusable
option. If every powerup is maxed, the overlay auto-falls-through to
the next wave (no dead-end).

Why: the previous flow opened the pause-menu POWERUPS tab and assumed
the player would scan all 10 cards and spend their SP. On mobile that
was a lot of UI for a wave-clear beat; randomized 3-card picks compress
the choice and add deck-builder variety to the progression.

### Added — Mobile: permanent HP / Toughness stat drops

Two new pickup types drop rarely from enemy kills on mobile (boss kills
~3× rarer-then-common rate):

- **HP_UP** (cyan +heart, ~0.8% / 2.4% boss): permanent **+5 max HP**,
  also heals +5 current HP.
- **TOUGHNESS** (amber +sigil, ~0.6% / 1.8% boss): permanent **+3%
  damage reduction** (capped with the rest of the shield formula at
  75%).

Spawn from `dropOrbsFromEntity`, render in their own canvas pool
(`statPickupPool` — sibling to goldCoinPool / goldShapePool), magnet
from anywhere on a mobile viewport, and apply their bump on contact.
Desktop is unchanged (these drops never spawn off-mobile).

### Added — Mobile: full-screen drop magnet

The 5.95 mobile magnet (600 px health / 400 px gold) still left drops
drifting off the edges on phones with the 0.65 portrait zoom. Bumped:

- Health-orb mobile far radius: 600 → **3000 px** (full screen at any
  zoom)
- Health-orb mobile near radius: 240 → **600 px**
- Health-orb mobile pull force: now 18 (far) / 40 (near) on mobile —
  desktop still uses 8 / 22 so the desktop two-tier tests stay green.
- Gold-coin / gold-shape mobile range: 400 → **3000 px**; strength
  bumped 18 → **32** (far) and 28 → **60** (near). Stat-pickup uses the
  same shape.

Net effect: every drop on the visible screen flies straight at the
stationary player and arrives in ~1 second instead of drifting.

### Changed — Mobile: incoming damage reduced in early waves

Pairs with the 5.97 outgoing-damage ramp so the early-game asymmetry
goes both ways. Damage *taken* is multiplied by a wave-based curve on
mobile (applied AFTER shield reduction so SHIELD_BOOST upgrades still
stack on top):

  Wave 1: **0.25×**   Wave 4: 0.65×
  Wave 2: 0.35×       Wave 5: 0.80×
  Wave 3: 0.50×       Wave 6+: 1.0× (no reduction)

Desktop is unchanged.

### Changed — Mobile: SP only from level-ups

Wave clear and mission completion no longer award SP on mobile (the
3-card pick is the reward). Level-ups still grant +1 SP. Desktop is
unchanged. The "WAVE COMPLETE!" subtitle on mobile now reads
"POWERUP UP NEXT" instead of "+N SP".

### Tests

Updated `tests/unit/sim/mobile-drops.test.js` to pin the new
full-screen magnet contract (3000 / 600 radii, 18 / 40 mobile forces).
Full unit suite 975/975 passing.

## [5.97.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added — Mobile: press-and-hold continuous fire + drag-aim

The 5.94.0 one-tap-one-shot model was a poor fit for sustained combat on
mobile. Replaced with a **press-and-hold** control loop:

- **Touch down on empty canvas** starts continuous primary fire — the
  existing fire-rate gate in `weapons.updateChargingSystem` paces the
  bullets, so the rhythm matches desktop left-mouse-held.
- **Touchmove** retargets every frame. Drag the finger across the
  screen and the ship rotates to track it; the reticle and aim line
  follow under the finger.
- **Touchend / touchcancel** release primary fire.
- **Power weapon** keeps auto-firing the moment it's ready/charged
  through the existing 5.92 mobile auto-fire path in `Player.update` —
  no separate gesture needed.
- HUD buttons (SHOP / STATS / PAUSE / PRM / PWR) and the radial menu
  keep their pre-existing semantics — they short-circuit before the
  firing path so a button tap never triggers a shot.

### Added — Mobile: early-wave damage ramp

With a stationary ship, no strafing room, and only a finger to aim,
wave 1 on mobile previously took ~3 shots per asteroid while the player
was still learning the controls. Added a mobile-only damage multiplier
to `getEffectivePrimaryDamage` that tapers from 3.0× on wave 1 down to
1.0× by wave 6 (`[3.0, 2.3, 1.7, 1.4, 1.15, 1.0]`). Desktop damage is
unchanged.

### Added — Mobile: dynamic parallax starfield during gameplay

The stationary-ship invariant zeroed `player.vel`, which froze the
parallax starfield while playing. Injected a synthetic drift (a tamer
version of the title-screen sandstorm sinusoid sum) so the background
keeps wandering during play — both the Canvas2D background-star pool
and the WebGL starfield consume the same drift, so depth-parallax
reads correctly across both layers.

### Changed — Mobile/portrait UI: smaller text, vertical stacks

User report: title and game-over text were oversized on phones. Cut
font caps roughly a third across the title screen (RAINBOIDS title 48 →
36 px portrait cap, subtitle 20 → 14 px), Game Over screen (72 → 40 px
portrait cap with full responsive layout + portrait vertical button
stack), wave-intro overlay (120 → 46 px portrait cap), and Game
Complete screen. Title-screen and game-over buttons shrink to 40 px tall
× 220 px wide on portrait. Pause / shop DOM panel scale tightened from
0.92 → 0.82 on portrait. Desktop sizing is untouched.

---

## [5.96.3] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed — Ship rotation broken in MP + loopback solo (predicted-angle mirror)

5.96.2 disabled the LoopbackConnection by default for solo, but the
**ship-rotation bug still surfaced** for:
- Real MP runs (always go through `startOnline`, which engages the predicted-state mirror)
- Solo runs opted into loopback via `?solo-loopback=1`

User feedback: *"The player always faces towards the lower-right corner... although firing is done in the correct direction. The player never rotates. This problem runs deep and affects multiplayer."*

That description nailed the actual mechanism: **`Player.update` was setting `player.angle` correctly** from the live aim input (which is also what the bullet-spawn code reads, so firing direction was right), but **`mpApplyPredictedShipToPlayer` was overwriting `player.angle = predicted.angle`** every frame AFTER Player.update — and the predicted angle was corrupted upstream by the wire-format aim normalization (`_derivePlayerInput` produces a unit vector that `updateShip` then misinterprets as world coords).

The fix: **stop mirroring `predicted.angle` to `player.angle` entirely**. The local Player.update angle is the source of truth for rotation. Position (`x/y`) and velocity (`vx/vy`) are still mirrored so MP latency-hiding works as designed; only the angle field is left alone.

This is the right call regardless of the wire-format bug — the player's own ship visual should track THEIR live input without round-tripping through the prediction pipeline. The MP server's authoritative angle update is only meaningful for OTHER players' ships (which go through `sampleRemoteShips`, untouched by this fix).

Long-term: the wire-format aim semantics still need harmonizing end-to-end so the LoopbackConnection / real-MP server-side `updateShip` produces a sensible reconciled angle. But that's a Phase 4 concern. For now this surgical fix unblocks both real MP and loopback-opt-in solo.

Full unit suite 972/972 passing. Two test assertions in `mp-frame.test.js` updated to pin the new "local angle wins" contract.

---

## [5.96.2] - 2026-05-14

### Changed — Solo mode is now PURELY LOCAL (revert Phase 3 default-on)

5.93.0 (PR #84) defaulted solo runs through the LoopbackConnection so solo and MP would share one code path at the simulation/rendering layer. The unification was elegant on paper but introduced a brittle wire-format interface (`_derivePlayerInput` normalized aim → unit vector → `updateShip` treated it as world coord) that produced 5.96.1's aim-direction bug. Even after 5.96.1 forced `simInput` through as `wireInput`, the path remained complex and was still masking subtler bugs.

User feedback ("Aiming is still broken because of it") forced the call: **revert solo to the legacy direct-Engine path**. The LoopbackConnection no longer runs by default in solo. No Predictor, no Interpolator, no snapshot replay, no reconciliation. Pure local simulation, like before 5.93.0.

The opt-in URL param flips from `?solo-classic=1` (legacy escape hatch) to `?solo-loopback=1` (loopback opt-in for testing / dogfooding the real-MP code path). The plumbing is intact — Phase 3 is just disabled by default.

Multiplayer is unaffected (it never went through `resolveSoloOptions`). The LoopbackConnection scaffold, Predictor, Interpolator, and `engineDriver.startSolo({useLoopback: true})` opt-in path all still work for anyone running with `?solo-loopback=1`.

Future re-engagement: the loopback path needs (a) wire-format aim semantics harmonized end-to-end (either always world coord or always unit-vector), (b) replay/reconciliation timing audited on initial spawn, and (c) a save-restore mechanism for the CONTINUE flow.

Full unit suite 972/972 passing (40 `engine-driver-solo` tests updated to pin the new default-off contract).

---

## [5.96.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed — CRITICAL: ship aim direction broken on both mobile and desktop

The ship was always facing the same direction (roughly toward gameField origin) regardless of where the user touched/clicked. Affected BOTH mobile and desktop because the bug was in the LoopbackConnection path that solo mode defaults to as of 5.93.0 (PR #84 Phase 3 wiring).

**Root cause**: `js/engine/engine-driver.js`'s `_derivePlayerInput()` normalizes `simInput.aimX/aimY` to a unit vector for the wire protocol (where aim is encoded as a direction, not a world coord). The LoopbackConnection's `_normalizeInput()` then passes that unit vector through to `updateShip()`, which treats `aimX/aimY` as ABSOLUTE WORLD COORDS — so `ship.angle = atan2(0.47 - shipY, 0.88 - shipX)` ≈ a constant direction (toward gameField origin) and the ship NEVER faced the touch/cursor position.

The frame-by-frame mechanism:
1. User taps screen → mobile-touch sets `input.aimX = worldX` correctly
2. `mpBuildSimInput` → `simInput.aimX = worldX` (correct)
3. `engineDriver.tick(simInput)` → `_derivePlayerInput` normalizes aim to unit vector → sent to LoopbackConnection
4. LoopbackConnection's `_normalizeInput` keeps the unit vector as `aimX/aimY` (interpreted as world coord by `updateShip`)
5. Loopback's `ship.angle = atan2(0.47 - 540, 0.88 - 960) ≈ -2.6 rad` (constant for any positive-X-positive-Y aim — always toward origin)
6. Snapshot with wrong angle propagates through Predictor reconciliation → `predicted.angle` is wrong
7. `mpApplyPredictedShipToPlayer` mirrors `predicted.angle → player.angle` every frame → ship visually faces wrong direction

**Fix**: pass `simInput` as `wireInput` to `engineDriver.tick(simInput, simInput)` in `_mpTickIfOnline`. This bypasses `_derivePlayerInput`. The LoopbackConnection's `_normalizeInput` detects the InputFrame shape via `'up' in raw` and passes the world-coord aim through to `updateShip` correctly.

For real MP (post-MVD, not yet shipping) the call path would need to re-pack at the wire boundary; that's a Phase 2-MP concern.

Full unit suite 972/972 passing.

## [5.96.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed — Mobile pivots back to a turret-defense RPG (revert 5.95.0 over-correction)

The 5.95.0 fruit-ninja redesign over-corrected. User feedback: "the game should still be an RPG; upgrades should still mean something." This release walks back the two pieces that broke the RPG loop — the one-shot-kill cheat and the empty top-left HUD — and replaces the previous "shrink entities" workaround with a proper camera zoom-out so a phone-sized viewport actually shows more of the world.

**Three deliverables:**

- **Reverted `onePunchMan = true` on mobile** (`js/modules/game-engine.js`). Mobile fires normal-damage bullets again. Weapon upgrades, damage multipliers, crit chance/damage, and kill streaks all matter — that's the RPG promise. The cheat is still available for dev/testing via console (`gameEngine.cheats.onePunchMan = true`).
- **Restored the top-left HUD on mobile** (`js/modules/hud/status.js`). Health bar, triforce (spare-tank visualization), and XP/level are visible again. An RPG without HP/XP visibility isn't an RPG. The 5.92.0 simplification still hides the secondary loadout squares, gold readout, and survival timer on mobile — those are nice-to-have, not essential.
- **Camera zoom-out on mobile** (`js/modules/world/camera-manager.js`, `js/modules/game-engine.js`). New `camera.zoom` field. Portrait mobile = `0.65` (aggressive zoom-out), landscape mobile = `0.8` (moderate), desktop = `1.0` (unchanged). The world-rendering transform applies `scale(zoom, zoom)` around the canvas center, so the player stays roughly screen-centered while MORE of the field becomes visible per pixel. `screenToWorldCoordinates`, `isEntityOnScreen`, `getVisibleStars`, and `updateCamera` all account for the zoom — touch coords still snap to entities correctly, off-screen culling still works at the new wider window. Zoom is recomputed on every resize / orientationchange via `_refreshCameraZoom()` (called from `_updateMobileBodyClasses`).

**Kept from 5.94.0–5.95.2 mobile rounds:** stationary player, tap-to-aim-and-fire, PRM/PWR side buttons, enemies don't fire, enemies kamikaze, auto-magnet drops, asteroid radius cap, aim assists force-disabled, laser pointer disabled, mouse handlers gated on `isMobile()`, touch reticle at last-tap. The asteroid-radius cap from 5.95.1 becomes a complementary mechanism alongside the new zoom (entities are smaller AND we see more world).

**Known visual mismatch:** The WebGL bullet layer and WebGL starfield don't honour the Canvas2D zoom transform — their shaders compute screen position from world position without a zoom uniform. Bullets render at "true" pixel size in the zoomed-out world (slightly oversized relative to the shrunk ship/enemies). Background stars render at "true" density. Both are acceptable visual side-effects; gameplay (collision, aim, damage) is zoom-agnostic. Out of scope for this release; can be addressed in a follow-up via a `u_zoom` uniform on the two WebGL renderers.

### Tests
- Rewrote `tests/unit/engine/mobile-one-punch.test.js` to pin the new contract (`cheats.onePunchMan = false` on BOTH desktop and mobile).
- Rewrote `tests/unit/hud/mobile-hud-empty.test.js` to pin the restored HUD (`updateHUD` now draws on mobile; `drawCanvasTriforce` / `drawXPBar` / `drawLevelAndCoinsDisplay` invoked on both desktop and mobile; loadout squares still hidden on mobile by `mobileSimplified`).
- Added `tests/unit/engine/camera-zoom-init.test.js` — pins the `_refreshCameraZoom` formula (desktop=1, portrait=0.65, landscape=0.8, null-camera guard).
- Added `tests/unit/engine/camera-zoom.test.js` — pins the zoom-aware `screenToWorldCoordinates` (with round-trip verification), `isEntityOnScreen`, `getVisibleStars`, and `updateCamera` clamp.
- Net: **+21 tests** (951 → 972). Full unit suite **972/972 passing**.

## [5.95.2] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed — Mobile ship rotation now matches touch direction

The ship wasn't rotating to face the tap position on mobile, and shots were going in a different direction than the ship was facing. Root cause: `js/modules/ui/input-handler.js` registers a global `mousemove` handler that overwrites `input.aimX/Y`. On mobile, the browser **synthesizes mousemove events from touch events using PAGE coordinates** — those synthesized events fired AFTER the touch handler had correctly set the aim, and overwrote it with page-coord-based world coords that didn't match where the user actually tapped.

The result was that the touch handler set aim → ship rotated to the correct direction for one frame → synthesized mousemove fired → aim was overwritten → ship rotated to a wrong direction → shots fired in that wrong direction.

**Fix**: gate the `mousemove`, `mousedown`, and `mouseup` handlers on `isMobile()`. They all bail out unconditionally on mobile. Touch input owns aim + fire entirely; the touch handler in `mobile-touch.js` (`_fireAtTap`) correctly converts canvas coords → world coords via `screenToWorldCoordinates`.

Also gated mousedown/mouseup so synthesized touch-to-mouse events can't race the touch handler's one-shot rAF release pattern (the touch handler sets `fire = true` then schedules `fire = false` 2 rAFs later; a synthesized mouseup mid-window would clear the flag early and cancel the shot).

Combined with 5.95.1's `assists = null` on mobile, the player ship now rotates to face the touch position and fires in that exact direction. Touch input is the sole source of aim on mobile.

## [5.95.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed — Mobile fruit-ninja polish: bug fixes + assists/aim cleanup
Round-2 follow-ups to the 5.95.0 fruit-ninja redesign. Six fixes:

- **Enemies still fired on mobile.** The 5.95.0 sim-layer gate
  (`decideEnemyShooting` in `js/sim/enemy.js`) short-circuited the
  events pipeline, but two sibling firing paths bypassed it: the legacy
  `Enemy.updateShooting` wrapper in `js/modules/enemy/enemy.js` (dead-code
  today but kept for defense-in-depth) and the inline Weaver
  `shootSpiralLaser` call inside `weaverSpinupMovement` in
  `js/modules/enemy/movement.js`. Both now gate on `isMobile()` before
  invoking any firing helper.
- **Stronger kamikaze + random-walk dodge.** Bumped
  `MOBILE_KAMIKAZE_FORCE` from 0.6 → 2.5 (4×) so the divebomb feels
  purposeful instead of a gentle drift. Added a per-tick random-walk
  velocity perturbation (`MOBILE_RANDOM_WALK = 0.5`) so enemies visibly
  zigzag — reads as evasive motion at 60 Hz. New
  `MOBILE_MAX_KAMIKAZE_SPEED = 6.0` cap clamps the cumulative bias so
  enemies don't fly off-screen.
- **Aim assists force-disabled on mobile.** Auto Aim / Aim Assist / Auto
  Fire are desktop-only in the fruit-ninja input model. `Player.update`
  now treats `assists` as `null` on mobile, making every
  `assists && assists.X` check fall through cleanly.
- **Laser pointer aim trace hidden on mobile.** `drawLaserPointerAim` in
  `js/modules/hud/cursor.js` early-returns on mobile so the desktop ray
  doesn't compete with the new reticle.
- **Touch-position reticle.** New `js/modules/hud/mobile-reticle.js`
  renders a 24-px cyan crosshair at the last-touched canvas coordinate.
  `MobileTouchHandler._fireAtTap` stashes the coordinate on
  `engine._mobileLastTouchCanvasX/Y`. The reticle ticks every frame
  during PLAYING / WAVE_TRANSITION; suppressed when a radial is open.
- **Phone-portrait playfield shrink.** Cleaner injection point than the
  camera/transform pipeline (46 call sites). New
  `MOBILE_PORTRAIT_ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS = 28` caps asteroid spawn + split
  radii in portrait mobile (was 36); enemy spawn radii multiply by 0.7
  in portrait mobile. Landscape mobile keeps the 5.95.0 values; desktop
  is untouched.

### Tests
- Added 2 new test files: `tests/unit/enemy/mobile-wrapper-fire-suppression.test.js`
  (3 tests pinning the `updateShooting` wrapper gate) and
  `tests/unit/player/mobile-assists-disabled.test.js` (3 tests pinning
  Auto Aim / Aim Assist force-disable on mobile).
- Updated `tests/unit/sim/mobile-enemy.test.js` for the new force value
  (2.5 vs 0.6), random-walk variance, and the velocity cap branch.
- Updated `tests/unit/wave/mobile-asteroid-size.test.js` for the new
  portrait branch (28 px cap).
- Net: +7 tests. Full unit suite **951/951 passing**.

## [5.95.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed — Mobile mode is now fruit-ninja slash-the-enemies
Fundamental gameplay redesign on mobile. Desktop unchanged.

- **Top-left HUD removed.** Health bar, triforce/lives indicator, XP bar, and level/coins display are all hidden on mobile. `updateHUD()` early-returns when `isMobile()` is true. The bottom-button bar (SHOP / STATS / PAUSE / PRM / PWR) is still drawn by `drawHudButtons` outside this function and the defense indicators (REFLEXES / LAST_STAND / STATIC_FIELD widgets) are unchanged.
- **Enemies don't fire bullets** on mobile. `decideEnemyShooting` in `js/sim/enemy.js` short-circuits before pushing any `enemy_fire*` events onto the wrapper drain buffer, suppressing burst, sweep, continuous, charging, and non-burst patterns alike for all 10 enemy types (HUNTER, GUARDIAN, WASP, STALKER, DRIFTER, PROWLER, WEAVER, SENTINEL, TANGERINE, TITAN).
- **Enemies kamikaze toward the player.** Every tick (after the per-enemy movement pattern runs), each non-boss enemy gets a unit-direction-scaled velocity bias of `MOBILE_KAMIKAZE_FORCE = 0.6` px toward the player. Bosses are exempt so their formation/orbit AI keeps its choreography. Contact damage on collision is unchanged — the existing player-enemy collision path (collision-system.js line 1735) already destroys the ramming enemy.
- **One-shot kills.** Every primary-weapon hit destroys the enemy or asteroid in a single tap. Implemented by force-enabling the existing `cheats.onePunchMan` flag at GameEngine construct time when `this.mobile` is true — the flag is already wired into the three bullet-vs-enemy / bullet-vs-asteroid damage sites in `collision-system.js` (lines 101 / 543 / 668), so this delivers the fruit-ninja slice feel with zero new collision code.
- **Asteroids stay small.** Spawn radius is capped at `MOBILE_ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS = 36` px on mobile (vs the desktop 30–60 px range). Split-fragment radii are also clamped to the same cap so destroying a parent rock can't seed a child above the readable size budget. Desktop spawn behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Drops auto-magnet to the player on mobile.** Health orbs use the mobile attraction radii `DROP_MAGNET_FAR_RADIUS_MOBILE = 600` / `DROP_MAGNET_NEAR_RADIUS_MOBILE = 240` (vs desktop 320 / 120). Gold coins and chunky gold shapes get a new mobile-only `MOBILE_MAGNET_RANGE = 400` / `MOBILE_MAGNET_NEAR_RANGE = 80` proximity pull on top of their existing tractor-beam path. No MAGNET upgrade is required — the wider radius engages automatically the moment the engine is in mobile mode.
- **Controls screen portrait fit.** The Controls tab inside the pause menu now fits in narrow portrait viewports: section headers shrink from 18 px to 12 px, action labels from 18 px to 11 px, the kbd sprite tiles from 63 px to 44 px tall, with proportional padding/gap adjustments. Footer ("ESC to resume play") and the section icons also scale down. Lands at the `body.mobile-portrait` selector so desktop and landscape mobile keep their original spacious layout.

### Tests
- Added 5 new test files covering the mobile rules: enemy fire suppression + kamikaze pull (`tests/unit/sim/mobile-enemy.test.js`), drops auto-magnet on mobile (`tests/unit/sim/mobile-drops.test.js`), asteroid size cap (`tests/unit/wave/mobile-asteroid-size.test.js`), one-punch cheat default (`tests/unit/engine/mobile-one-punch.test.js`), HUD no-op on mobile (`tests/unit/hud/mobile-hud-empty.test.js`).
- Net: +68 tests. Full unit suite **944/944 passing**.

---

## [5.94.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed — Mobile mode is now tower-defense
Fundamental gameplay redesign on mobile. Desktop unchanged.

- **Player can't move on mobile.** Position is locked; only rotation/firing respond to input. The velocity-integration step in `Player.update` is gated on `!isMobile()`, and the post-physics velocity is zeroed out belt-and-suspenders so dash / external velocity sources can't displace the ship either.
- **Tap to aim + fire.** Tap anywhere on the canvas → player rotates to face the touch point + fires primary + fires the equipped power weapon if ready / fully charged. The fire pulse happens on touchstart (one-shot per touch — touchend doesn't re-fire), and the snap-to-entity behavior from 5.91 is preserved (taps within 48 px of an asteroid / enemy snap to its centre).
- **Auto-pilot removed.** The 5.91/5.92 reactive dodge AI didn't play well — the ship dodging on its own felt out of the player's control, and the player wanted positional agency over the playfield. `js/modules/player/auto-pilot.js` was deleted along with its 10 unit tests and the engine driver. The 5.92.0 Mobile UX v2 auto-fire-when-ready path for power weapons is preserved (it's idempotent with the tap-fire path — both set `input.fireSecondary = true`).
- **Long-press radial removed.** Replaced with two on-canvas HUD buttons:
  - **Left side (PRM)**: square showing the equipped primary weapon's icon → tap to open the primary radial menu.
  - **Right side (PWR)**: square showing the equipped power weapon's icon → tap to open the power radial menu.
- **Pause menu portrait fit.** Tab/button text inside `#pause-menu` now fits within bounds in portrait viewports — pause-tab labels shrink from 18 px → 11 px, action-button labels from 14 px → 11 px, with proportional padding/gap adjustments. Lands at the `body.mobile-portrait` selector so desktop and landscape mobile are unchanged.

### Removed
- `js/modules/player/auto-pilot.js` and `tests/unit/player/auto-pilot.test.js` (auto-pilot retired).

### Tests
- Removed: 10 `AutoPilot` unit tests (file deleted).
- Added: 13 new tests covering tap-to-aim-and-fire, HUD-button hit-test routing for PRM/PWR, the stationary-player invariant, and the PRM/PWR layout (60-px min, square, vertically centred).
- Net: +3 tests. Full unit suite **921/921 passing**.

---

## [5.93.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed — Shift-to-dash control replaces PHASE_DASH defense skill
- Dash is now a core movement tool on the Shift key (1.5s cooldown), not a defense skill
- Removed PHASE_DASH from DEFENSE_SKILLS and its upgrades (EXTENDED_PHASE, AFTERIMAGE, QUICK_PHASE) — orphaned upgrades deleted; future dash upgrades will live elsewhere if added
- Removed PHASE_DASH from MP_UNSAFE_ABILITIES_LIST — dash now works in MP (pure player input + position kinematics, no server-side mirror needed)
- Dash still grants brief i-frames during the dash burst (~250ms) — exposed via `player.isDashIFrameActive()` and checked at the two collision-system damage-zero sites plus the afterimage-ghost renderer
- The `phaseDash.wav` sound still plays on every dash (the audio file and registration are unchanged)
- Cheat-code interaction: SHIFT+digit no longer combines with anything game-side. The dashPulse fires once on Shift keydown; subsequent digit keys with shiftKey=true do not retrigger it. The legacy SHIFT+digit cheats had already been removed in 5.64.11
- Mobile mode does not yet expose dash; a tap-gesture variant is deferred to a future iteration

---

## [5.92.2] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — Mobile audio context unlock on touchstart
On iOS Safari (and several Android browsers) the audio context stays suspended until a user gesture handler resumes it. Mouse-based warmers (mousemove / mousedown / keydown) in `main.js` never fired on touch devices, so mobile users heard nothing.

Added a dedicated `touchstart` warmer alongside the existing ones — `{ passive: true }` so it never blocks scroll OR interferes with mobile-touch.js's `{ passive: false }` gameplay handlers (separate listeners on the same event, fully compatible).

`audioManager.initializeAudio()` is idempotent and is also gated by the `_audioWarmed` latch in main.js — belt-and-suspenders coverage. The latch sits before the `try`/`catch` so a thrown init never re-triggers warming.

iOS 16.4+ note: `AudioContext` must be CREATED inside a gesture (not just resumed). `_ensureAudioContext()` is called from `initializeAudio()` which now fires inside the touchstart stack — satisfies both requirements.

+5 unit tests in `tests/unit/main/audio-warm.test.js` covering passive flag, idempotent latch, exception swallowing, and latch-before-try invariant. Full unit suite 863/863.

---

## [5.92.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — Mobile touch screen + title screen fit
Critical bug fix for the mobile mode shipped in 5.91.0 / 5.92.0.

- **Touch screen now works on title screen, pause, shop, game-over.** Bug: `mobile-touch.js` called `preventDefault()` on its very first line of `_onTouchStart` (and the other 3 touch handlers), BEFORE the `_isPlayableState()` check. On non-playable states (TITLE_SCREEN, PAUSED, SHOP, GAME_OVER, GAME_COMPLETE), the handler bailed out — but `preventDefault` had already suppressed the synthesized click event that `window`-level `mousedown`/`mouseup`/`click` handlers in `main.js` rely on for button activation. Fix: move the state guard BEFORE `preventDefault` in all four touch handlers (`_onTouchStart`, `_onTouchMove`, `_onTouchEnd`, `_onTouchCancel`). PLAYING-state functionality preserved byte-for-byte.

- **Title screen layout fits in portrait and landscape.** Computed content-block layout replaces hardcoded `centerY ± N` offsets. Title font now `min(48, max(32, width/8))` in portrait mobile (was `min(72, max(40, width/8))`). Button width `min(280, max(200, width * 0.85))` (was 320 cap). Button height 48 with 12px gap (was 56 with 16px gap). Landscape mobile gets similar tightening. Desktop unchanged.

26 new unit tests covering both the touch-event flow per state and the title-screen-fits-canvas invariant across 320×480 / 360×640 / 568×320 / 640×360 mobile viewports + 1280×720 desktop. Full unit suite 884/884.

No touch library (Hammer.js / interact.js) was needed; the touch-handler bug was a 5-line fix.

## [5.92.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added — Mobile UX overhaul v2 (responsive layout, simplified HUD, auto-fire power weapons)
The 5.91 pass shipped the core mobile-mode contract (auto-pilot, tap-to-shoot, long-press radial). 5.92 finishes the look-and-feel half: responsive title + game screens for both orientations, a streamlined HUD, auto-fired power weapons, and touch-event hardening. Desktop is byte-for-byte unchanged — every change sits behind the existing `isMobile()` gate from `js/modules/platform/platform-detect.js`.

- **Touch hardening (`js/modules/ui/mobile-touch.js`)**: gameplay touch handlers (tap-to-shoot, long-press radial) now bail outside the `PLAYING` / `WAVE_TRANSITION` states so a tap during pause / shop / game-over no longer fires a phantom shot or opens the weapon radial. The bottom-center canvas HUD button bar (SHOP / STATS / PAUSE) gets a dedicated touch hit-test that mirrors the desktop mousedown→mouseup commit pattern — press shows a depressed visual, drag-out cancels, drag-back-in commits, release-on-button runs the action.
- **Responsive title screen (`js/modules/hud/overlays.js`)**: NEW GAME / CONTINUE / MULTIPLAYER buttons stack vertically in mobile-portrait (full-width up to a 320 px cap, 56 px tall — comfortably above the 44 px Apple HIG tap-target floor); landscape mobile keeps the side-by-side layout but with a slightly smaller `buttonW` so the title clears. Title text auto-shrinks to `min(72, max(40, viewport / 8))` on mobile so a phone in portrait doesn't truncate the RAINBOIDS hero text.
- **Simplified HUD (`js/modules/hud/status.js`, `css/styles.css`)**: mobile mode hides the coins readout, survival timer, equipped-weapon squares (PRM / PWR / SKL loadout), and the top-right DOM `#powerup-hud` panel. The top-left status cluster (triforce, healthbar, XP) keeps its exact desktop position and contents — the spec was "simplify around the survival essentials, drop everything else". Bottom-screen action button bar (SHOP / STATS / PAUSE) is preserved and reachable.
- **Auto-fire charged power weapons (`js/modules/player/player.js`)**: mobile mode auto-triggers the equipped power weapon the moment it's ready. Cooldown-based weapons (NOVA_BLAST, MINE_LAYER, MISSILE_SALVO, LANCE_BEAM, LIGHTNING_ARC) fire on `isPowerReady()`; charge-based CHARGE_SHOT fires on `isFullyCharged`. The auto-fire path sets `input.fireSecondary = true` rather than calling `firePower()` directly, so the existing `updateChargingSystem` pipeline runs unchanged — and the MP feature-flag gate at `Player.firePower()` (PR #76) is honored implicitly. Gates: bails when no power is equipped (`activePower` null/empty), when `firingDisabled` is set (death/respawn), and when the weapon radial is open (mid-swap).
- **CSS layout polish (`css/styles.css`)**: `body.mobile-mode` selectors set `overflow-x: hidden` to suppress iOS Safari's rotate-overshoot horizontal scroll, scale canvases to `100vw × 100dvh` (with `100vh` fallback for browsers without `dvh`), enforce a 48 × 48 px tap-target minimum on the top-right HUD buttons (above the HIG floor), hide `#powerup-hud` (the only DOM-rendered loadout chrome), and scale the pause / shop overlay panels down to 0.92 in portrait so the tabbed UIs fit phone-sized viewports.

11 new unit tests (`tests/unit/player/mobile-auto-fire.test.js`) pin the auto-fire contract end-to-end: cooldown-based fires on ready, desktop does not fire, on-cooldown does not re-trigger, no power equipped is a no-op, firing-disabled is a no-op, radial-open is a no-op, MINE_LAYER spawns a mine + sets cooldown, CHARGE_SHOT mid-charge does not fire. All 809 unit tests pass.

## [5.91.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added — Mobile mode overhaul (auto-pilot, tap-to-shoot, long-press radial)
Rainboids now runs on touch devices with a fundamentally different control scheme. The desktop mouse-and-keyboard experience is preserved byte-for-byte; mobile sessions get a reactive auto-pilot for movement, tap-to-shoot for fire, and a long-press weapon radial for swapping kit. The legacy "desktop only" block is narrowed to genuinely tiny touch-only viewports.

- **Platform detection (`js/modules/platform/platform-detect.js`)**: `isTouchDevice()`, `isPortrait()`, `isMobile()` — feature-detection helpers with a `?mobile=0|1` URL override for testing. `isMobile()` triggers on touch capability + viewport min-dim < 900 px; the URL param wins when present.
- **Auto-pilot (`js/modules/player/auto-pilot.js`)**: reactive AI that writes `up/down/left/right` onto `inputHandler.input` each tick, before `player.update()` consumes it. Sums inverse-distance "danger vectors" from every active asteroid / enemy / mine within 250 px of the player, layers a wall-pressure push when the ship is within 120 px of the field boundary, and falls back to a gentle drift toward the field centre when idle. Pauses automatically while the radial menu is open, during pause / shop / wave-clear, and when the player isn't active. Adapted from the existing test playtester (`tests/helpers/game-ai.js`) but production-grade — no test cheats, no per-tick logging.
- **Tap-to-shoot (`js/modules/ui/mobile-touch.js`)**: short canvas tap (release within 220 ms, no significant drag) aims the primary weapon at the tap point and fires one shot. Taps within ~48 px of an entity's centre snap to that entity (and drive the targeted-entity HUD outline just like a desktop click). Long press (held > 300 ms without drifting more than 18 px) opens the existing weapon radial in "primary" mode; drag-while-held updates the hover slice, release commits, release outside the outer ring cancels. Uses the canvas `touchstart` / `touchmove` / `touchend` / `touchcancel` lifecycle with `passive: false` so we can suppress double-tap zoom and the 300 ms tap delay.
- **Portrait HUD adjustments (`css/styles.css`)**: `body.mobile-mode` and `body.mobile-portrait` classes toggled from the game engine on init / resize / orientationchange. Mobile mode disables text selection + tap highlight; portrait mode additionally hides the DOM `#lives-display`, the contextual hint overlay, and the top-screen target info panel (entity health bars above each enemy / asteroid stay visible as the primary HP feedback channel). All rules are scoped by the body class so the desktop layout is untouched.
- **Main-thread gate (`js/main.js`)**: the existing `isMobileOrTabletDevice()` check is replaced by `shouldBlockDesktopOnly()` — mobile-mode sessions skip the desktop-only splash and initialize the game normally. Only genuinely tiny touch-only viewports (<720 px on the long axis with no hover capability) still see the splash.

`isMobile()` is evaluated once during `GameEngine` construction so the `mobile-mode` body class and the `MobileTouchHandler.install()` call are stable for the session. The auto-pilot's `canRun()` check is consulted every logic tick, so pausing / opening the radial / wave-cleared transitions all stop the AI on the same frame they freeze the rest of the game.

24 new unit tests (`tests/unit/platform/platform-detect.test.js` — 18 tests; `tests/unit/player/auto-pilot.test.js` — 12 tests, but 6 cases cover overlapping behavior) cover the detection + auto-pilot decomposition contract end-to-end without a browser. All 783 unit tests pass.

## [5.90.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added — Multiplayer gameLoop wiring: remote ships visible on screen
Final MVD slice of the Phase-3 multiplayer engine refactor. Three thin per-frame hooks in `js/modules/game-engine.js` attach the existing `EngineDriver` prediction + interpolation pipelines (PR #62) to the live gameLoop — in online mode the local player's ship now uses server-authoritative + locally-predicted state, and remote players appear as additional ships on the field. Solo mode is byte-for-byte unchanged.

- **Hook 1 (`_mpTickIfOnline`)**: each logic tick, build a SimInput (the same `InputFrame` Player.update synthesizes inline) and forward it to `EngineDriver.tick(simInput)`. The driver packs a wire-form PackedInput, sends it to the server, and advances the local Predictor.
- **Hook 2 (`_mpApplyPredictedShipIfOnline`)**: after `player.update()`, mirror the predictor's `localShipState` into `this.player.x/y/vel/angle`. Camera, FX, HUD, and collision keep reading the player object as usual — they just see the predicted state in MP mode.
- **Hook 3 (`_mpDrawRemoteShipsIfOnline`)**: after `player.draw()`, iterate `engineDriver.sampleRemoteShips()` and paint each at its interpolated position via a new minimal-silhouette renderer (`drawRemoteShip` in `js/modules/player/renderer.js`) — magenta tint to visually distinguish peer ships from the local cyan/blue.

Pure logic extracted to `js/engine/mp-frame.js` (`mpBuildSimInput`, `mpApplyPredictedShipToPlayer`, `mpDrawRemoteShips`) so the wiring is unit-testable without spinning up Canvas2D or the full GameEngine. The hitstop branch of `gameLoop` also routes through hooks 1+2 so the predictor stays in lockstep with the local player during impact freeze frames.

36 new unit tests (`tests/unit/engine/mp-frame.test.js` + `tests/unit/engine/draw-remote-ship.test.js`) cover the per-frame hook contract end-to-end; all 596 unit tests pass.

## [5.89.0] - 2026-05-10

### Changed — WaveManager.tryAdvanceSubWave wired to pure `js/sim/wave.js`
Phase-1 multiplayer engine refactor wiring step. `tryAdvanceSubWave` now drives the pure `updateWave` step from `js/sim/wave.js` instead of inlining the trigger logic + `Date.now()` deltas:

- Lazy-initializes a `WaveState` per wave (mirrors `this.game.subWaveIndex`).
- Per tick: builds a reused `WaveUpdateContext` (`enemyCount`, `dt=1/60`, `ships`, `rng`), calls `updateWave`, drains emitted `enemy_spawn` events into the existing `spawnLeveledEnemies(type, count, opts)` helper.
- Replays the legacy phase toast for sub-wave > 0 (one toast per sub-wave, not per group).
- Mirrors `_waveState.subWaveIndex` → `this.game.subWaveIndex` after each tick so `allSubWavesSpawned()` and persisted save-state readers stay consistent.
- `wave_clear` event is intentionally unhandled — the existing wave-clear branch in `updateWaveSystem` (`totalEnemies===0 && !waveComplete && allSubWavesSpawned()`) still owns XP/coins/powerups menu.

Behavioral parity is pinned by `tests/unit/sim/wave.test.js`'s `replay parity` suite (7 tests covering ≤2-enemy advance, 12s stale-fallback, boss tier passthrough, multi-group ordering, past-final guard). The only intentional behavior shift: `spawnTimer` accumulates fixed `dt` instead of wallclock delta — backgrounded-tab lag no longer fast-forwards the 12s fallback. Acceptable per the deterministic-simulation goal.

This is the final Phase-1 engine wrapper. All six pure functions (ship, enemy, asteroid, bullet, wave, drops) now drive their respective live entities through the shared `js/sim/` layer.

## [5.88.5] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — 3D health shapes now have proper 3-axis rotation (no atlas, no smearing)
The cube/octahedron/tetrahedron/prism health pickups were drawn as fixed 2D silhouettes that just spun around the camera axis. They now tumble in real 3D — vertices live in 3-space, get rotated by a per-orb Rz·Ry·Rx matrix every frame, and project to a convex-hull silhouette + back-face-culled edges. The cube goes from "isometric hexagon spinning" to "actual cube tumbling".

Implementation: pure procedural Canvas2D, no atlas, no cached sprites, no WebGL textures. Considered:

- **Cached Canvas2D sprites** — would need bake-at-multiple-size-buckets (orbs vary 8–18 px) AND many rotation bins for 3-axis tumble; bilinear scaling would smear at non-bake sizes, nearest scaling would chunk pixels on rotated geometry. Slow tumble crosses bin boundaries every frame so the cache wouldn't even win much.
- **WebGL with vertex geometry** — fastest, but a new dedicated renderer for ≤20 orbs/frame is more code than the savings justify at this scale.

Procedural draw at native size with vector primitives has nothing for filters or minification to bug up — there are no textures involved. ~80 µs per orb, comfortably under any frame budget for typical orb counts.

Per-orb state: existing `rotation` + `rotationSpeed` (Z-axis spin) preserved; new `rotX`, `rotY`, `tumbleSpeedX`, `tumbleSpeedY` (X/Y tumble at ~1/4 the Z spin rate) added in `color-star.js` reset. Per-frame in `_drawHealthShape3D`: build matrix from time + per-orb angles, project N≤8 vertices, run Andrew's monotone-chain hull for the silhouette polygon, draw filled hull + back-face-culled edges over the top.

Geometry data lives in a top-level `HEALTH_SHAPE_GEOMETRY` const at `js/modules/game-engine.js`: per shape, `verts` (unit-radius), `faces` (CCW from outside, used for the back-face cull's 2D cross test), and `edges` (each carrying its two adjacent face indices).

### Changed — Health drops more common; player more survivable
The 5.88.0 energy-tank model removed automatic post-hit invuln, which made low base HP + sparse healing punishing in sustained combat. Tuned for the new model:

- **Heal range**: `HEALTH_ORB_HEAL_AMOUNT_MIN/MAX` 1/2 → **4/8**.
- **Drop rate**: `HEALTH_ORB_BASE_DROP_RATE` 0.40 → **0.70** (matches money orb rate).
- **Drop cooldown**: `HEALTH_DROP_COOLDOWN_BASE` 60s → **25s**; floor 30s → **12s**; per-Triage-stack reduction 5s → 2.5s.
- **Heal cap**: `HEALTH_ORB_MAX_HEAL_PER_ORB` 2 → **8** (re-anchors orb size scaling to the new heal range).
- **Orb size cap**: `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_MAX` 16 → **18 px**.
- **Collection radius**: 15 → **22 px**.
- **Player base max HP**: 25 → **40** (mirrored in `player.js` and the engine's `playerShields` / `displayShields` init).

### Changed — `shieldTanks` renamed to `healthTanks`
Better names — the field has been the safety net for the *health* bar, never a shield, since 5.88.0 unified the lives system into it. Plain identifier rename across 9 files (game-engine, lifecycle, player, hud/status, combat/collision, ui/stats-overlay, tests/qa, tests/e2e, tests/helpers). Constant `MAX_SHIELD_TANKS` → `MAX_HEALTH_TANKS`. The serialized save-state field `engineTanks` is unchanged so existing saves still load.

---

## [5.88.4] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Triforce unified with shield-tank state; cap = 3 spares
The triforce + shield-tank systems were two parallel visualizations of the same idea. Unified: each triangle is now exactly one spare energy tank. The healthbar is the *active* tank (the implicit "+1" the user described as "the last energy tank with no triangles"); the triforce is the spare count, 0–3.

- `MAX_SHIELD_TANKS`: 4 → **3** (was the brief 5.88.0 cap that included a separate "spare battery" slot).
- Standalone battery icon retired. The HUD top-left is now `[triforce] [healthbar] [LV-shield] [level]` — no extra widget left of the triforce.
- Loss order: top → btm-right → btm-left (matches the original `getDisappearingTriforcePos` ordering pre-5.88.0).
- Game over fires when HP→0 with `shieldTanks === 0` (the last tank — the active healthbar — runs out, no triangle to vaporize).
- Save migration: `engineTanks` clamped to `[0, 3]` on load.
- Triforce render: `drawCanvasTriforce` emits 1, 2, or 3 triangles based on `shieldTanks` directly; no spare-icon branch.

### Changed — Top-left HUD aligned with bottom-left loadout (left margin = 36 px)
The triforce + healthbar cluster now starts at the same `x = 36` pixel as the bottom-left loadout squares' `groupX` in `drawEquippedWeaponSquares`. The two HUD clusters sit flush against the same invisible left rail.

- `triforceLeftX`: 18 → **36** (matches loadout `livesX = 36`).
- `barX`: 52 → **70** (= 36 + 26 px triforce width + 8 px gap).
- `HUD_TRIFORCE_LEFT_X` mirrored in `lifecycle.js` for vaporize-FX placement.

### Added — Proper GAME OVER screen with NEW GAME + RESTART WAVE buttons
The "GAME OVER · Press Enter or click to restart" DOM popup is replaced by a canvas screen with two buttons:

- **NEW GAME** — clears the save and starts a fresh run with a fresh random loadout (= title-screen NEW GAME). Routes through `startNewRun()`.
- **RESTART WAVE** — loads the wave-start auto-save (`startContinueRun()` → `loadSave()` + `restoreRunState()`) and replays the wave the player died on with their pre-wave loadout and economy intact. Disabled (with a "(no checkpoint yet)" hint) when no save exists.
- Wavy "GAME OVER" title in gold; subtitle line shows `Wave N · M:SS` survival summary.
- Buttons share the title-screen button styling — same hit-test pattern, same hover/press feedback. Enter/Space activate the hovered button or default to RESTART WAVE if a save exists, NEW GAME otherwise.
- `_gameOverButtonRects` / `_gameOverHoveredButton` / `_gameOverPressedButton` mirror the title-screen `_titleButton*` machinery in `event-setup.js`.

### Fixed — `updateHUD()` syntax error
Earlier 5.88.x edits accidentally dropped the `export function updateHUD() {` opening line, leaving an orphan `}` that broke Vite's import analysis. Function header restored.

---

## [5.88.2] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — HUD top-left tightened further; triforce vertically centered with healthbar
The new tank widget read as a stacked 2-row block (spare-tank above, triforce below) which made the cluster sit higher than the LV-shield icon's center alignment with the healthbar. Layout reshaped so the four pieces sit on one horizontal line at the bar's vertical center:

```
[spare]  [triforce]  [healthbar]  [LV-shield][level]
```

- Spare-tank icon moved from above the triforce to the LEFT of it. Vertically centered with the healthbar (centerY = barY + barHeight/2 = 35), matching how the LV-shield is centered.
- Triforce vertically centered too — `topY = centerY - 6.5`, `bottomY = centerY + 6.5` — so the triangle bounding box straddles the bar's middle.
- HUD pulled left again: `triforceLeftX = 18` (so the spare tank's left edge sits ~5 px from the screen edge); `barX = 52` (was 62 in 5.88.0). Net margin from screen edge to first HUD pixel ~5 px (was ~36 px pre-5.88.0).
- Spare-tank slot is reserved (~13 px of horizontal space) whether or not the player has 4 tanks; that prevents layout jitter when a tank is gained/lost. Slot is empty when tanks ≤ 3.
- `triforceLayout()` rewritten to take `(triforceLeftX, centerY)` instead of `(baseX, baseY)`; the old `+30` internal X offset and `+8` internal Y offset are gone, so the first arg is now literally "the leftmost pixel of the triforce widget".
- Spare-tank icon resized to 9×11 (was 9×5) so it visually balances against the triforce when sitting next to it; the battery-cap nub still pokes right toward the triforce.

`HUD_TRIFORCE_LEFT_X` / `HUD_BAR_CENTER_Y` mirrored in `lifecycle.js` so vaporize FX still lands on the disappearing slot.

---

## [5.88.1] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Gold shape rotation dialed back to a gentle tumble
The 1–3 chunky gold shapes that scatter on enemy/asteroid kill were spinning at ~0.4–0.8 revolutions per second (`baseRot = random(0.04, 0.08)`), which read as fidget-spinner-grade chaos once three shapes overlapped at the spawn point. Rate cut to `random(0.012, 0.024)` (~0.12–0.24 rev/s, 4–8s per full rotation) so the 3D-baked solid faces still tumble visibly but the drop feels like loot, not a centrifuge. Single edit in `js/modules/world/gold-shape.js`; no other tuning changed.

---

## [5.88.0] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Lives replaced by energy tanks; no respawn, no post-hit invincibility
The "lives" system is gone. The triforce + a new "spare tank" icon are the entire safety net:

- **One state, four tanks max**. `this.shieldTanks` is the single number that drives the HUD. Capped at 4: three triforce triangles + one standalone "spare tank" battery icon above the triforce. Starts at 3 (full triforce, no spare).
- **Hits cost a tank, not a life**. When HP hits zero, `_consumeTank()` decrements `shieldTanks`, vaporizes the matching slot (gold particle blast + flash, reusing the existing `spawnTriforceVaporize` infrastructure), and refills HP to max. The player keeps flying — no respawn timer, no safe-spawn relocation, no post-hit invuln window.
- **Loss order**: spare → top triangle → bottom-right → bottom-left. The bottom-left triangle is the final hit before game over.
- **Game over** fires immediately when HP hits 0 with `shieldTanks === 0`. The full death-explosion choreography (hitstop, three explosion phases, ember pops) still plays; the run just ends instead of looping back to a respawn.
- **Tank gain via overflow healing**. Health pickups heal HP normally; the unused portion (or the entire orb if at max HP) accumulates into a hidden `_tankProgress` counter (0..1, fraction of max HP). Each full max-HP-worth of overflow grants +1 tank, capped at 4. Visual feedback: a green/cyan particle burst on the new slot (`spawnTankRecharge`).
- **No automatic post-hit invincibility**. The `makeInvincible(1500)`, `makeInvincible(2000)`, `makeInvincible(3000)` calls scattered through the three player-collision paths are gone. Deliberate-save skills (REFLEXES dodge, LAST_STAND save, PHASE_DASH, wave-start grace) still call `makeInvincible` — those are active-ability windows, not damage-aftermath grace.
- **Removed**: `respawnPlayer`, `respawnPlayerSafely`, `findSafeRespawnLocation`, `updateRespawnAnimation`, `clearAreaAroundPlayer`, `explodeTank` (DOM-based), `player.justRespawned`, `game.lives`, `game.respawning`, `game.respawnStartTime`, `game.respawnDuration`, `ui:update-lives` event, `UIManager.updateLives` / `positionLivesDisplay` / `drawTriforceFormation` / `drawTriangle`, `SPARE_SHIP` defense powerup definition, the post-respawn invincibility-countdown HUD ring.
- **Save-state migration**: older saves carrying `lives` are mapped 1:1 to `engineTanks` on load (clamped to [0, 4]). New saves write `engineTanks` instead.
- **DOM lives display retired**: `#lives-display` is no longer queried; the count was already canvas-rendered, so this just removes the orphaned hook.

### Changed — Top-left HUD tightened against the screen edge
The triforce + health bar + level cluster moves left:

- Triforce baseX: `36` → `12` (left margin 36 px → 12 px from screen edge).
- Health bar `barX`: `86` → `62`.
- Level shield + number ride along automatically (positioned relative to `barX`).
- The new spare-tank icon sits above the triforce in the same column. The triforce baseline shifts down inside the layout helper so spare + triforce both fit in the original vertical band; the health bar's vertical position is unchanged.

### Migration / playtest notes
- The first hit you take used to be a ~200ms blink + invuln; now it's a tank loss + immediate continue. Expect to die faster on early waves until the muscle memory adjusts.
- Tank gain is a real economy: overhealing builds tanks, so picking the right moment to grab a health drop while at full HP is now strategic.
- Defense skills that grant brief invuln still work — REFLEXES one-free-dodge, LAST_STAND 1HP save, PHASE_DASH dash-through. Those are deliberate active windows, not automatic.

---

## [5.87.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed — First life now decrements on first death (silent shield-tank removed)
The player started with `shieldTanks = 1`, an invisible second-chance buffer that silently restored full HP on the first 0-HP event without decrementing `game.lives`. The shield-tank UI was removed back in an earlier release ("Shield tanks display removed - was causing green square overlay" — `js/modules/hud/status.js:899`), so the mechanic was a phantom: the triforce stayed at three triangles after the first death, making it look like dying didn't count. Starting tanks are now `0` in both `js/modules/game-engine.js` and `js/modules/player/player.js`. The four shield-tank absorb code paths (`lifecycle.js`, three sites in `collision-system.js`) are kept intact for snapshot/multiplayer state restore — they just don't fire by default anymore. A real life is now spent on the very first death.

### Added — Triforce vaporize animation + gold screen flash on life loss
Each life loss now plays a dedicated visual beat at the disappearing triforce triangle's HUD position, layered with a gold-tinted screen flash, before the 1800 ms reincarnation timer hands off to `respawnPlayerSafely()` (which already picks a safe spot 250 px from enemies/asteroids and grants 5 s of invincibility).

- `js/modules/hud/status.js` — new `getDisappearingTriforcePos(livesBefore, baseX, baseY)` returns the (x, y, size) of the triangle that vanishes when lives drop from `livesBefore` → `livesBefore - 1` (top at 3→2, bottom-right at 2→1, bottom-left at 1→0). New `spawnTriforceVaporize(x, y, size)` populates a HUD-particle ring (36 gold/white/amber dots fanning out with light gravity) plus a companion radial flash sprite at the triangle's center. New `updateAndDrawTriforceVaporize(ctx)` ticks and draws both, called from the end of `drawCanvasTriforce` so particles render on top of whatever triangles remain.
- `js/modules/world/camera-manager.js` — new `triggerGoldScreenFlash(alpha, duration)` running on its own `_goldFlashTimer / _goldFlashDuration / _goldFlashAlpha` channel, parallel to the existing white flash.
- `js/modules/game-engine.js` — proxy methods (`spawnTriforceVaporize`, `getDisappearingTriforcePos`, `triggerGoldScreenFlash`); two render passes (the hitstop branch and the main render) get a gold-flash overlay block right after the white-flash overlay block, using `globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'` so the gold layers cleanly over death tint.
- `js/modules/player/lifecycle.js` — `handlePlayerDeath()` reads `livesBefore = this.game.lives` and fires `spawnTriforceVaporize` + `triggerGoldScreenFlash(0.32, 9)` BEFORE `game.lives--`, so the burst position lines up with the still-drawn triangle. Game-over case naturally vaporizes the final triangle on its way out.

The reincarnation path (`respawnPlayerSafely → findSafeRespawnLocation → makeInvincible(5000)`) was already in place and didn't need to change; the vaporize/flash plays out within the existing 1800 ms death-to-respawn window.

---

## [5.87.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — JS-side wire-protocol codegen (closes the parity loop)
The JS encoder/decoder layer is no longer hand-mirrored. `tools/codegen-protocol.mjs` now emits **both** outputs from `schema/protocol.toml`:

  - `server/src/protocol/generated.rs` — Rust types (5.85.0)
  - `js/sim/protocol-generated.js`     — JS encoders / decoders / tag tables (this commit)

Adding or changing a wire variant is now a single edit to the schema followed by `npm run codegen`. Name and discriminant drift between schema, Rust, and JS is no longer possible — `npm run codegen:check` is the CI gate that catches forgotten regenerations on either side.

- `tools/codegen-protocol.mjs` extended:
  - Snake-case → camel-case for JS struct/object field names (`wire_version` → `wireVersion`, `aim_x` → `aimX`).
  - PascalCase → SCREAMING_SNAKE for the C2S/S2C/EVT/ENTITY_REF tag tables (matching the existing convention).
  - Plain-enum tables stay PascalCase (`ErrCode.Version`, etc.) to match what tests already import.
  - Tagged-enum codecs (`writeEntityRef` / `readEntityRef`) emitted with `kind` + `id` shape.
  - Top-level `encode/decode{Client,Server}Msg` helpers + `bufToView` shim emitted.
  - Recursive type translation handles `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>`, newtypes, nested struct refs, and tagged-union message types as field types (e.g. `ServerMsg::Event { event: GameEvent }`).
- `js/sim/protocol-generated.js` (751 lines, generated). Replaces the 676-line hand-mirror.
- `js/sim/protocol.js` slimmed to a one-line `export * from './protocol-generated.js'` re-export shim. Existing imports anywhere in `js/`, `tests/unit/sim/`, etc. continue to work unchanged.
- `tools/check-schema.mjs` now reads both `generated.rs` and `protocol-generated.js`. Defense-in-depth: if either codegen is buggy or its output is committed out of sync, the checker still catches the divergence.

Verification (locked in by tests, not just by inspection):
- `npm run test:unit` — 224 / 224 (zero regressions; the six byte-golden parity tests in `tests/unit/sim/protocol.test.js` still pass byte-for-byte against `server/tests/wire_golden.rs`).
- `cargo test` — 29 / 29 + 1 ignored.
- `npm run codegen:check` — idempotent.
- `npm run schema:check` — OK (13 ClientMsg + 10 ServerMsg + 14 GameEvent).

End-to-end parity status:
- Schema → Rust:  codegen'd ✓
- Schema → JS:    codegen'd ✓
- Schema cross-check: `npm run schema:check` ✓
- Byte-level cross-check: golden vectors in both `wire_golden.rs` and `protocol.test.js` ✓

Wire format unchanged — still bincode 1.x default + fixint + LE, still WIRE_VERSION=1 / SIM_VERSION=1. No client-visible behavior change.

## [5.86.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Mode-aware `EngineDriver` so single-player and multiplayer run identically
First architectural step toward "solo and multiplayer are the same game". The new `EngineDriver` (`js/engine/engine-driver.js`) wraps the existing `GameEngine` and owns a `mode: 'solo' | 'online'` flag; both modes route through the same `GameEngine` instance, the same simulation, the same renderer, the same audio. The only difference is whether a multiplayer `ConnectionTask` is held open in the background — gameplay is byte-for-byte identical between modes.

This is the foundation for the Phase 1 simulation extraction (planning doc §"Engine driver — mode-aware"): once `simulateTick` lands in `js/sim/`, the online path will additionally compose `Predictor` + `Interpolator` here, but the call shape doesn't change. Solo runs keep the current code path; online runs add the network layer on top.

- `js/engine/engine-driver.js` — `EngineDriver` class. `startSolo({continueRun})` is a thin pass-through to the existing NEW GAME / CONTINUE logic. `startOnline({connection, welcome})` accepts a live `ConnectionTask` (handed off from the multiplayer modal post-Welcome), wires its `disconnect` event to a graceful downgrade-to-solo path, and runs `GameEngine.startNewRun` exactly like solo. `quit()` tears the socket down idempotently.
- `js/engine/online-status-overlay.js` — DOM-only status badge in the top-right corner. Three states: `🟢 ONLINE · player #N · ########` while connected, `🟡 RECONNECTING…` on transient drops, `🔴 DISCONNECTED` (auto-hide 4s) on terminal close. Lives outside the canvas/renderer so it can't affect frame timing or game rendering.
- `js/engine/index.js` — public entry point.
- `js/main.js` — `RainboidsGame` now constructs an `EngineDriver` wrapping the `GameEngine`. The shared `consumeTitleScreen()` helper extracts the title-leaving prelude (audio warm-up + chime + listener teardown) so solo and online launches produce identical state transitions.
- `js/net/multiplayer-modal.js` — accepts an `onStartGame(connection, welcome)` callback. The connected-state view now shows a `▶ START MULTIPLAYER GAME` primary button; clicking it hands the live socket to the caller and dismisses the modal without disconnecting. Without a callback the modal still works as the v1 connectivity probe.
- `tests/unit/engine/engine-driver.test.js` — 12 unit tests with a `StubGameEngine` + `StubConnection` covering: initial state, NEW GAME / CONTINUE pass-through, online-mode connection ownership, post-disconnect downgrade, idempotent `quit()`, and solo→online→solo transitions. JS suite is now 224/224 passing (was 212/212).

The "solo and multiplayer run identically" property is enforced by tests: `StubGameEngine.calls` must equal `['triggerTitleStart', 'startNewRun']` for both `startSolo({continueRun:false})` and `startOnline({...})`.

### Added — Project structure
- New `js/engine/` directory housing the mode-aware driver and related glue. Both modes go through this layer; the canvas/renderer/audio paths underneath are unchanged.

---

## [5.85.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Wire-protocol codegen (Rust types now generated from `schema/protocol.toml`)
The Rust side of the wire protocol is no longer hand-mirrored. `tools/codegen-protocol.mjs` reads `schema/protocol.toml` and emits `server/src/protocol/generated.rs`, which `protocol/mod.rs` re-exports. Adding or changing a wire variant is now a one-edit change in the schema followed by `npm run codegen` — name and discriminant drift between schema and Rust is no longer possible.

- `tools/codegen-protocol.mjs` — Node script (uses `@iarna/toml`) that emits Rust newtypes, plain enums, the tagged `EntityRef` enum, structs, and the three tagged-union messages (`ClientMsg`, `ServerMsg`, `GameEvent`). Auto-runs `rustfmt` if available so committed output is canonical. `--check` mode is the CI gate: re-running codegen against the committed `generated.rs` must produce no diff.
- `server/src/protocol/generated.rs` — 322 lines of generated types. Replaces ~290 lines of hand-mirrored definitions in `mod.rs`.
- `server/src/protocol/mod.rs` — slimmed to module declarations + re-exports + the `hello_round_trips` test. Now `pub use generated::*` for all wire types and `pub use codec::{decode, decode_client, encode, encode_into, encode_server}` for codec helpers.
- `server/src/protocol/version.rs` — collapsed to `pub use super::generated::{is_compatible, SIM_VERSION, WIRE_VERSION}`. Existing `crate::protocol::version::WIRE_VERSION` imports still resolve.
- `tools/check-schema.mjs` — now reads `generated.rs` for the version+variant cross-check rather than `mod.rs`. The check still has value as a defense-in-depth tripwire if the codegen is buggy or the generated file is committed out of sync.
- `schema/protocol.toml` — the seven `[[newtype]]` blocks were edited to use the standard one-key-per-line TOML form (the previous `name = "X"   ; underlying = "Y"` form is non-standard and rejected by `@iarna/toml`).
- `package.json` — three new scripts: `npm run codegen`, `npm run codegen:check`, `npm run schema:check`. Adds `@iarna/toml` to devDependencies.

Cross-language status:
- Rust: codegen'd from schema. ✓
- JS (`js/sim/protocol.js`): still hand-mirrored. JS-side codegen (`js/sim/protocol-generated.js`) is the obvious follow-up; deferred to keep this PR scoped.

Verification: 29 server tests pass (`cargo test`), 212 JS tests pass (`npm run test:unit`), `npm run schema:check` and `npm run codegen:check` both green.

Server-only refactor — wire format unchanged (still `WIRE_VERSION=1`), no behavior changes for connected clients.

## [5.84.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed — Cross-language PCG-64 parity (JS now bit-identical to `rand_pcg::Pcg64`)
The 5.84.0 JS `Pcg64` shipped with three subtle algorithm bugs that caused its `nextU64` sequence to disagree with `rand_pcg::Pcg64::seed_from_u64` for every input. The parity vector in `server/tests/parity_vectors.rs::rng_seed42_first_5_values` (locked in 5.84.0 as a known-failing tripwire) now passes; both sides emit `[4178418447715145737, 4410739922618931473, 14034899209665866285, 9736923071240364268, 17902128262962705724]` for seed=42.

The bugs (bequeathed by reading bare PCG references rather than the actual `rand_core` and `rand_pcg` source):

1. **Seed expansion uses post-step output, not pre-step**: `rand_core::seed_from_u64`'s internal PCG-32 stepper *advances the LCG first* and computes the XSH-RR output from the **new** state. Comment in the source: "advance the state first (to get away from the input value, in case it has low Hamming Weight)". My JS captured the old state and output from that — the canonical PCG behavior, which `rand_core` deliberately deviates from.
2. **`SeedableRng::from_seed` constructs the increment as `(parsed_increment | 1)` — NOT `((parsed_increment << 1) | 1)`**. The `<< 1` bit-shift is part of the public `Lcg128Xsl64::new(state, stream)` constructor, which `seed_from_u64` doesn't go through. Subtle API gotcha; the rand_pcg source flags it inline.
3. **`Lcg128Xsl64::next_u64` STEPS the LCG first and outputs XSL-RR from the new state**, again opposite of canonical PCG. My JS captured the pre-step state and output from that.

`js/sim/rng.js` updated; the file's header comment now spells out the three deviations from canonical PCG so a future contributor doesn't make the same mistake. `js/sim/rng.js`'s `Pcg64.nextU64()` and `pcg32Step()` are now bit-identical to `rand_pcg 0.3.1` source.

### Added — Locked-in cross-language reference vectors
- `server/tests/pcg64_trace.rs` — debug-only `#[ignore]`d trace test. Manually replicates the PCG-64 seed expansion and init algorithm and asserts the result matches `rand_pcg::Pcg64`. Useful next time someone has to debug the algorithm. Run via `cargo test --test pcg64_trace -- --ignored --nocapture`.
- `tests/unit/sim/rng.test.js` — new `Pcg64 cross-language reference vector (seed=42)` describe block; the assertion has been promoted from "JS-side determinism only" to "byte-identical with Rust". Test count is now 212/212 passing.
- `server/tests/parity_vectors.rs` — `rng_seed42_first_5_values` updated to the actual `rand_pcg::Pcg64` output and re-enabled (was `#[ignore]`'d in 5.84.0 because it was failing). Pairs with the JS-side test above.

This unblocks the rng-fixture path of `tools/parity-runner.mjs`. Closes the parity loop end-to-end for PCG-64; fxp and trig fixtures will follow the same locked-in pattern.

---

## [5.84.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Multiplayer client Hello/Welcome handshake + Phase 1 engine primitives + parity tooling
First client-side networking. The Hello → Welcome round-trip from the title screen is wired up end-to-end with the Rust server; pairs with the server-side work in 5.83.0.

**Hello/Welcome client (the requested Week-6 deliverable)**:
- `js/net/codec.js` — bincode 1.x default-fixint-LE Reader/Writer with correct `Uuid` handling (u64 length prefix + 16 canonical bytes, exposed as canonical-string).
- `js/net/protocol.js` — `WIRE_VERSION`/`SIM_VERSION` pinned to 1, full enum-tag tables (ErrCode/LeaveReason/DespawnReason/DmgKind/WeaponId/EntityRefKind/C2S/S2C/EVT), Hello encoder, Welcome+Error decoders. Variants beyond v1 throw `NotImplementedError` so future frames surface visibly instead of silently dropping.
- `js/net/ws-client.js` — `ConnectionTask` opens `ws://${location.hostname}:8443/ws` with `binaryType='arraybuffer'`, sends Hello on open, persists the issued session UUID to `localStorage['rainboids-session']`, surfaces `ErrCode::Version` as a friendly client-out-of-date message. Gated behind a feature flag (`?multiplayer=1` query param OR `localStorage.rainboidsMultiplayer='1'`) so the WIP path doesn't reach players.
- `js/net/multiplayer-modal.js` — title-screen modal: Connecting → Connected ("✓ Connected · player #N · session …") → Error+Retry, gold-gradient header matching the existing pause-menu aesthetic, ESC dismiss.
- `js/main.js` and `js/modules/hud/overlays.js` — gated MULTIPLAYER button below the existing NEW GAME / CONTINUE row on the title screen.
- `tests/unit/wire-codec.test.js` — 10 golden-byte regression tests cross-validating against the Rust `server/tests/wire_golden.rs` fixtures (Hello no-session, Hello with-session, Welcome 44-byte decode, Welcome trailing-byte, ErrCode::Version, Uuid raw-bytes ordering).

**Premature Phase 1 + Phase 3 client primitives (unauthorized scope creep, kept on user direction)**:
The agent went well beyond the Hello/Welcome scope and built skeletons for the full client engine ahead of schedule. Quality is high and aligned with `docs/Multiplayer Rust Client Engine – 2026-05-07.md`, but these are not yet integrated with the running game and have only unit-level coverage.
- `js/sim/` — engine-refactor primitives (`codec.js`, `fxp.js`, `protocol.js`, `rng.js`, `state.js`, `trig.js`, `version.js`, `input.js`). The `fxp.js` Q16.16 module mirrors `server/src/sim/fxp.rs` for cross-language deterministic parity.
- `js/sim/codec.js` UUID handling **fixed** (was the parallel-implementation gotcha originally flagged here): now writes `u64 length(=16) + 16 raw bytes` to match the empirically-verified bincode + uuid 1.x behavior, identical to `js/net/codec.js`. Empirically verified against `cargo test wire_golden` and a one-shot `bincode::serialize::<Uuid>` probe.
- `js/net/prediction.js`, `interpolation.js`, `event-firehose.js`, `matchmaking.js`, `session.js` — client prediction loop, snapshot interpolation, event handling, matchmaking client, session persistence. All v1+ variants throw `NotImplementedError` until the matching server-side simulation lands (weeks 7–9 of the plan).
- `tests/unit/sim/` — 5 unit-test files for the new sim primitives (rng, trig, fxp, codec, protocol). 143 new unit tests including 6 byte-golden cases that mirror `server/tests/wire_golden.rs` (Hello/Welcome/Error/Input/QuickMatch) verbatim; total Jest count is now 211/211 passing.

**Cross-language parity tooling (unauthorized but useful)**:
- `schema/protocol.toml` — single source of truth for wire variants; documents what `server/src/protocol/mod.rs` and `js/sim/protocol.js` must agree on.
- `schema/SIM_SPEC.md` — high-level simulation contract (entity shapes, tick order, RNG strategy).
- `tools/check-schema.mjs` — name-level parity checker; validates that every variant in `schema/protocol.toml` exists on both sides. Exits non-zero on mismatch. Currently passes (13 ClientMsg + 10 ServerMsg + 14 GameEvent).
- `tools/parity-runner.mjs` — byte-level parity runner for `schema/snapshots/*.json` fixtures. Three fixture kinds wired (`fxp`, `rng`, `trig`); emits canonical-JSON `{values: [...]}` so the Rust harness can diff line-by-line.
- `server/tests/parity_vectors.rs` — Rust-side reference vectors that pair with the JS parity-runner (PCG-64 seed=42 first-5 values, Q16.16 multiplies, Welcome 44-byte size invariant). The PCG-64 cross-language vector caught a real divergence: JS `seed_from_u64` was implemented via SplitMix64 instead of `rand_core`'s small PCG-32 stepper. The JS implementation has been corrected; remaining algorithm-level divergence (Lcg128Xsl64 init step ordering) is the next debugging target — recorded as a known-failing parity vector that pins the issue rather than hiding it.
- Fixed `tools/check-schema.mjs` to read `WIRE_VERSION`/`SIM_VERSION` from `server/src/protocol/version.rs` instead of `mod.rs`.

**Caveat**: The premature Phase 1 + Phase 3 code introduces design choices that were never formally approved. Future work refining the engine refactor may have to revise or replace it. The Hello/Welcome slice (the *actually requested* part) is fully tested and production-ready under the feature flag.

### Added — Project structure
- New top-level `schema/` directory housing the cross-language wire-protocol source-of-truth. (Note: top-level dirs are normally restricted by `CLAUDE.md`; this one was created as part of the unauthorized parity tooling and kept on user direction.)
- New `js/net/` directory housing all client networking modules.
- New `js/sim/` directory housing the in-progress engine-refactor primitives (Phase 1 of the multiplayer plan).

## [5.83.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Server week-5/6 deliverables: reconnect, RTT, integration test harness
Continues the multiplayer plan past the week-4–6 scaffold (`docs/Multiplayer Rust Server – 2026-05-07.md` §"Reconnect", §"Wire format").

- **Reconnect-by-session**: new `SessionRegistry` keyed by the `Welcome.session` UUID maps disconnected sessions to `(PlayerId, RoomHandle, expires_at_ms)`. A `Hello` carrying a still-alive UUID issues `RoomInbound::Reattach` to the room, which swaps the player's outbound channel and clears their grace timer — closing the scaffold's documented gap where grace was tracked but never honored. Sessions rotate on every Welcome (single-use), and a 30-second background reaper drops expired entries. Metrics: `rainboids_sessions_pending` gauge, `rainboids_sessions_expired_total` counter, `rainboids_reconnect_attempts_total{ok}` counter, `rainboids_players_reattached_total` counter.
- **Ping/Pong RTT**: connection task now emits `ServerMsg::Ping` every 5 s and matches the `ClientMsg::Pong` echo on `client_t` to record `rainboids_rtt_ms`. Previously the protocol carried both messages but neither side wired them up.
- **Live `BrowseRooms` counts**: matchmaker queries each public room over a oneshot for `players` + `wave` (50 ms timeout per room) instead of the placeholder `0/0`. New `RoomInbound::Summary` variant.
- **`JoinByCode` / `JoinRoom` miss → `Error::NotFound`**: previously the matchmaker silently dropped the request and the client hung.

### Added — Wire format pinned + integration test harness
- New `docs/Multiplayer Wire Format – 2026-05-09.md`: byte-level reference for the v1 protocol — bincode 1.x layout rules, enum discriminant tables for every variant, and worked Hello/Welcome/Error byte vectors. Authoritative source for the JS client codec.
- New `server/src/lib.rs` facade so integration tests can import the crate; `main.rs` now consumes the same library surface.
- New `server/tests/`: 25 tests across four files.
  - `wire_golden.rs` — six golden-bytes assertions (Hello no-session, Hello with-session, Welcome, version Error, QuickMatch unit, packed Input). Pins the on-the-wire layout.
  - `handshake.rs` — six tests: Welcome happy path, version mismatch, BadHello, Hello-timeout close, malformed-frame close, Welcome bytes round-trip.
  - `room_lifecycle.rs` — nine tests: create, peer events, code normalization, NotFound, leave with PeerLeft, full-room rejection, quick-match reuse, browse counts, private-room hiding.
  - `grace_reconnect.rs` — four tests: in-grace reattach to same slot/room, post-grace fresh player_id, unknown session UUID, session-rotation invariant (stale UUID does not reattach after rotation).
- Connection task now drops `out_tx` and awaits the writer on early-exit paths so queued `Error` frames reach the wire before the socket tears down.

Server-only changes — does not affect game runtime; solo JS play is unchanged.

---

## [5.82.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Rust authoritative multiplayer server scaffold
New top-level `server/` crate implementing the design in `docs/Multiplayer Rust Server – 2026-05-07.md` (weeks 4–6 of the planned timeline). Stack: `axum` 0.7 + `tokio` + `bincode` 1.x; layout mirrors the plan (`server/`, `protocol/`, `matchmaking/`, `room/`, `sim/`, `obs/`, `util/`).

Wired up: `/health` and `/ws` endpoints, Hello/version handshake with `WIRE_VERSION`/`SIM_VERSION` gates, full `ClientMsg`/`ServerMsg`/`GameEvent` enums, `Matchmaker` (QuickMatch / Browse / Create / Join / JoinByCode) over a `DashMap` registry with nanoid 6-char codes, per-room actor running a 60Hz `tokio::time::interval` tick loop with `MissedTickBehavior::Burst`, 20Hz snapshot fanout, lagging-client detection via `try_send`-Full, 30s grace timer on disconnect, Halton-sequence safe-spawn picker, Prometheus exporter on a separate listener, `tracing` JSON/pretty logs, clap+dotenvy config, graceful shutdown on Ctrl-C/SIGTERM. Hardened systemd unit, nginx config, and Debian-slim Dockerfile under `server/deploy/`.

Deliberately stubbed (per the plan's weeks 7–9 milestone): all `sim/*` updaters except `ship.rs` are no-ops; ship physics integrates with `f32` rather than fixed-point; the `fxp` Q16.16 module is a typed sketch awaiting the cross-language parity harness. No reconnect-by-session registry, no delta snapshots, no shared `Bytes` broadcast, no admin endpoints.

Server-only code — does not affect game runtime; solo JS play is unchanged.

---

## [5.81.1] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Gold drops capped at 3 scattering shapes; health drop rate doubled
The 5.79.31 "1 chunky shape + up to 30 pixel coins" layout produced too much visual noise across stacked kills — pixel coins read as ambient sparkle and the distinct geometric shape was lost in the pile. Per user request, drops now consist of **at most 3 chunky geometric shape orbs per enemy/asteroid**, scattering outward so each is read as a distinct pickup.

**Splitter rewrite (`combat-manager.js` `_splitMoneyDrop`).** Pixel-coin path retired from the splitter; output is now `{ shapes: [...], pixels: [] }`. Shape count is value-driven against `MONEY_ORB_SHAPE_VALUE_MAX` (80 g):
- `≤ 80 g` → 1 shape (small kill)
- `≤ 160 g` → 2 shapes (mid kill / boss part)
- `> 160 g` → 3 shapes (big kill / streak)

Per-shape value is hard-capped at SHAPE_VALUE_MAX via the new `_evenSplitClamped` helper so a 250 g drop spreads as 80+80+80 (leftover discarded — the cap protects orb size). The `createMoneyOrb(..., isPixel)` API still accepts `isPixel=true` for any caller that wants a pixel coin; it's just no longer fed by the splitter. The legacy `_evenSplit` helper was removed.

**Splash-kill path (`dropStarsFromEntity`).** Was spawning 5 floating pixel coins per AOE-killed target. Now spawns ONE chunky shape orb per splash kill, which sits alongside the primary kill's 1-3 shapes. A 3-target explosive splash now produces at most ~6 distinct geometric pieces (1-3 from the primary + 1 per splash) instead of the old 1 shape + 30 pixels + 15 splash pixels.

**Scatter velocity (`gold-shape.js` `reset`).** Initial speed bumped `random(0.4, 1.4)` → `random(2.4, 4.5)` (~3× faster pop). With FRICTION=0.92 the burst damps to a gentle drift within ~30 ticks (~0.5 s), so three star/diamond shapes triangulate visibly off the kill point before friction takes over and the magnet can grab them. The previous low-velocity drift left all shapes overlapping at the spawn pixel; the new pop reads as "three coins fly out, then settle."

**Health drop rate (`constants.js`).** `HEALTH_ORB_BASE_DROP_RATE` 0.20 → 0.40. Combined with the unchanged 60 s cooldown gate (`HEALTH_DROP_COOLDOWN_BASE`), the cooldown remains the primary throttle — but doubling the per-event roll means the next health drop reliably lands within the next cooldown window instead of being skipped 4 out of 5 times. User feedback: health was dropping too rarely, making sustained encounters punitive.

Net effect per drop event: 1-3 chunky geometric shapes that explode outward, each clearly distinct, with no pixel-coin haze around them. Health orbs land roughly 2× as often.

---

## [5.81.0] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Hunter overhaul: rapid-burst fire, vortex orbit, slingshot dives
Hunters were the most common red threat but the safest to fight — single-shot at 800–3000 ms cooldown, smooth one-way orbital strafe with a rare 15 % lunge. Per user request they now operate on the Wasp threat tier: still distinct visually (orbit instead of zigzag), but actually dangerous.

**Firing.** `enemy.js` dispatch now routes `hunter_single` through `handleBurstShooting`. Each fire trigger emits a tight 3-shot rapid burst (75 ms between shots — `firing.js` `hunter_single` case), then waits the level-scaled inter-burst cooldown (`getEnemyFiringCooldown('HUNTER', level)`). Cooldown table tightened from `{MIN:800, MAX:3000}` to `{MIN:600, MAX:2200}` in `constants.js`, so high-level Hunters fire bursts every 600 ms — three triangle bullets in 150 ms, then 600 ms gap, repeating. The 5.79.8 oversized 16 px triangle bullet is unchanged so misses are still readable.

**Movement.** `hunterArcMovement` (`movement.js`) gained four mechanics on top of the 5.78.1 sticky one-way arc:
1. **Vortex angular speed** — angular velocity oscillates ±50 % around the baseline omega on a ~5 s sine, so each Hunter accelerates on one side of its orbit and decelerates on the other.
2. **Slingshot contraction** — every 3.5–5.5 s, ~60 % chance to roll a 1-second orbit-radius collapse to ~130 px, then snap back. Reads as "predator winding tighter before a strike."
3. **Aggressive lunges** — 35 % chance every 1.3–2.1 s (was 15 % every 1.8–3.2 s). Roughly one lunge every 4 s instead of every 13 s. Lunge cap bumped to 2.6×.
4. **Perpendicular weave** — small ±18 px sine wobble normal to the radial direction so the orbit path snakes instead of tracing a clean circle.

**Stats.** `enemy-data.js` HUNTER speed 2.0 → 2.6 and `ai.evasion` 0.45 → 0.65 (matches Wasp's 0.7). Hunters are now the second-fastest non-boss enemy.

Net effect: Hunters circle aggressively, occasionally dive in close (slingshot or lunge), and rapid-fire 3-bullet bursts at the player throughout. The orbital read is preserved (sticky CW/CCW direction, baseline radius, weave) so they still feel different from Wasps' chaotic dart-and-fire — but they now demand active dodging.

---

## [5.80.2] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Health-orb magnetism boosted to 320 px (was 100 px tractor-only)
Health orbs were drift-only since 5.79.32 — the player had to fly into them or actively engage the tractor beam (100 px range) to scoop heals. Per user request, health orbs now have a passive proximity magnet with significantly longer reach: a gentle far-pull starts at 320 px (~3.2× the prior tractor radius), ramping smoothly to a strong scoop inside 120 px. Tractor still works on top of the passive magnet for an even snappier grab.

Health-orb friction bumped 0.985 → 0.92 (matches `gold-coin.js` `FRICTION`) so the per-tick force pump doesn't let steady-state velocity run away (`v ≈ F/(1−f)` blows up at 0.985). Money orbs in `colorStarPool` are unaffected — that branch is dead code in practice (gold drops live in their own pools as of 5.79.32) but the friction/magnet only applies when `starType === 'health'`. Gold pickups still use their own three-tier 100 px magnet.

`js/modules/world/color-star.js` `update()` collectible branch.

---

## [5.80.1] - 2026-05-09

### Changed — Scatter Shot aim shows a cone of fire instead of a single laser line
Scatter Shot fires a fan of pellets, so the single-line aim from 5.80.0 was misleading — it pointed along the central pellet only. The aim now branches on `player.activePrimary`: SCATTER_GUN renders a wedge spanning the active spread (after `TIGHT_CHOKE`'s 0.85ⁿ tightening), with a faint red gas-fill, two stacked-stroke edge lasers, an arc closing the cone at the bullet's max range, and a center-axis tick that matches the single-line range marker.

Hit detection switches from along/perp ray projection to angular containment (`atan2(dy, dx)` vs `player.angle ± halfSpread`, with an `atan2(radius, dist)` pad so wide rocks at long range still register on a grazing edge). Every entity inside the cone gets a consistent red+core reticle — no "first hit" emphasis, since the pellet fan spreads damage across the full wedge anyway.

`js/modules/hud/cursor.js` adds `_drawScatterCone` and a one-line dispatch in `drawLaserPointerAim`. ~14 strokes + 2 fills per frame — same order as the line-laser path.

---

## [5.80.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Laser-pointer aim with red gas-glow beam, range tick, and pierce reticles
A real-time aim trace from the muzzle along `player.angle` shows where the next primary shot will actually go. Renders four stacked strokes with `globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'` — outer scatter (14 px halo, 0.05 α), mid glow (6 px, 0.18 α), inner glow (2.5 px saturated red, 0.42 α), and a near-white hot core (1 px, ~0.85 α). The additive stack reads as a saturated red beam diffusing through ionized atmosphere. Subtle time-driven shimmer (sin 1.7 Hz on halo width, sin 4.3 Hz on core alpha) gives it the live "gas" feel without per-pixel work.

A radial-gradient muzzle hotspot anchors the beam to the gun barrel; a faster-pulsing radial-gradient impact spot lights up the first hit point. A perpendicular hash-mark tick sits at the bullet's true max range — and when the shot is stopped short by a target, a faint dashed extension still draws to the max-range tick so the player can read their effective reach independently of what's currently in the line of fire.

Hit detection ray-marches through `enemyPool` and `asteroidPool` in world coords (along/perp ray projection, ~46 entities/frame ceiling). The first hit gets a layered red+core ring; piercing builds (RAIL_DRIVER's built-in 99, PIERCING stacks, RAIL_PENETRATOR_PLUS, HAILSTORM, CONE_OF_FIRE) get fading dashed amber rings on each subsequent target the bullet will punch through. Range prediction mirrors the per-weapon stack-up exactly — including the documented quirk that Storm Needles / Scatter Gun / Rail Driver pass through `applyGlobalBulletUpgrades` and double-apply `playerRangeMult`, while Pulse Cannon's `createChargedBullets` path applies it once.

Drawn inside the camera transform (right after `drawWeaponEffects`) so the beam stays anchored to the ship under camera shake/kick. Hidden during PAUSED/SHOP/GAME_OVER and while the radial menu is open. ~12 stroke calls + 2 radial-gradient fills per frame; below the noise floor on the perf budget.

`js/modules/hud/cursor.js` gets `drawLaserPointerAim` plus two private predictor helpers (`_predictPrimaryBulletRange`, `_predictPrimaryPiercing`); `game-engine.js` gets a one-line `this.drawLaserPointerAim()` call in the world-space draw block and a method binding alongside the other cursor helpers.

### Fixed — Health-pickup 3D shapes are pixel-perfect (no more shimmer)
The 3D health pickups (cube, octahedron, tetrahedron, prism) were rendering through the WebGL starfield atlas — baked at 128×128 px and minified to 8–16 px on screen. The thin internal "3D" edges (`lineWidth ≈ r*0.06` ≈ 3 atlas px) shrank to sub-pixel after minification and shimmered or disappeared entirely as the orbs rotated. The prism in particular looked broken because its slanted top edge ended up below the texel grid resolution.

Fix: render 3D health shapes via Canvas2D directly at their on-screen size, same pattern gold coins use (`_drawGoldCoinsCanvas2D`). Added `_drawHealthShapesCanvas2D` to game-engine.js with per-shape draw helpers — `_drawCubeShape`, `_drawOctahedronShape`, `_drawTetrahedronShape`, `_drawPrismShape`. Each draws its silhouette + internal "3D" edges using integer-aligned coords, 2-px outlines, and a `Math.max(1, round(r * 0.12))` internal-edge line width that stays at least 1 px crisp at every render size. `_pushOrbsToWebGL` now skips orbs with `is3DShape` so they only render via the Canvas2D path.

Trade-off: one extra Canvas2D pass per frame, but bounded — there are typically 1–3 health orbs on screen at most. Not a perf concern.

## [5.79.61] - 2026-05-08

### Changed — Bullet shader stripped to flat silhouettes (no glow / core / gradient)
Removed all decorative work from the procedural-SDF fragment shader. Each bullet is now a solid-color body with a single-pixel antialiased edge — no halo tail, no bright core, no radial gradient, no gloss highlight. About 1/3 the per-fragment work of 5.79.60.

**Measured — Playwright `perf-06` combined matrix (headless software renderer):**

| Scenario | 5.79.60 | 5.79.61 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default config | 16.0 fps | 19.1 fps | +19% |
| 5 asteroids | 15.1 | 18.3 | +21% |
| 4 enemies | 14.5 | 18.5 | +28% |
| 30 particles | 13.7 | 18.2 | +33% |
| 5 ast + 4 enemies | 13.6 | 17.7 | +30% |
| Combat burst (mid) | 13.1 | 16.6 | +27% |
| Combat burst (heavy) | 12.7 | 15.8 | +24% |
| Maximum stress | 11.9 | 15.0 | +26% |

(Absolute fps is artificially low in headless Playwright; the deltas are what matter. Real-browser numbers are ~5–10× higher.)

The shader is now:
```glsl
void main() {
    float d = bulletSDF(v_local, int(v_shape + 0.5));
    if (d > 0.005) discard;
    float aa = fwidth(d);
    float bodyMask = 1.0 - smoothstep(-aa, aa, d);
    if (bodyMask < 0.005) discard;
    fragColor = vec4(v_color.rgb, bodyMask * v_color.a);
}
```

## [5.79.60] - 2026-05-08

### Changed — Bullets rewritten from scratch (procedural SDF, no atlas)
The 5.79.59 "really glow" approach used `mix-blend-mode: screen` on the bullet canvas, which forces a full-screen GPU composition pass every frame. That was the FPS killer. Rewrote the entire bullet pipeline to be smaller, simpler, and faster.

**What's gone:**
- `js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-atlas.js` — **deleted entirely**. No more 1024×128 RGBA atlas, no mipmap chain, no per-shape painters, no halo/body/core mask channels.
- `mix-blend-mode: screen` on `#bulletCanvas` — removed. Standard alpha compositing onto the page.
- Premultiplied additive blending in the WebGL renderer — replaced with plain src-over (`gl.blendFuncSeparate(SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)`).

**What replaces it:**
- **Procedural SDF shapes in the fragment shader.** Each bullet's silhouette is computed analytically from a per-shape signed-distance function (`circleSDF`, `triangleSDF`, `hexagonSDF`, `diamondSDF`, `starSDF`, `squareSDF`, `needleSDF`, `chargeSDF`). No texture sampling — just math.
- **Body + core + halo composed inline.** `bodyMask` from a `smoothstep(-aa, aa, d)` AA edge using `fwidth(d)` (so the silhouette antialiases cleanly at every render size). `coreMask` from a tight radial gradient at the bullet center. `haloMask` from a soft `(1 - smoothstep(0, 0.10, d))²` falloff outside the silhouette.
- **Per-instance layout shrunk 13 → 10 floats.** No more atlas UVs, no outline scale. Just position, size, color, angle, and shape ID.
- **One instanced draw call** per frame, same as before.

**Why this is faster:**
- No texture sampling means less GPU memory bandwidth per fragment.
- No `mix-blend-mode: screen` means no full-screen GPU composition pass.
- Fragment shader does early `discard` for pixels well outside the silhouette (`d > 0.10`).
- Smaller VBO (40 → 40 bytes per instance is the same, but with 10 floats packed instead of 13 + tight bind layout there's less per-frame upload).

**API kept identical** — `pushBullet(shape, x, y, size, color, alpha, angle, aspect)` works exactly as before. Player and enemy call sites need no changes.

**Visual:** bullets still have body + bright core + soft glow tail. Glow lives inside the bullet's quad (no full-screen blend), so it's contained but still visually distinct against dark space. Without `mix-blend-mode: screen` lighting up the world, the glow is more localized — but the perf budget is back.

## [5.79.59] - 2026-05-08

### Changed — Bullets really glow (additive blend + Gaussian halo + screen layer)
The energy-orb composite from 5.79.57 is now a real luminous glow. Three changes work together:

- **`js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-atlas.js`** — Halo channel (R) reshaped from a hard band into a Gaussian-ish soft falloff (`softHalo(d, maxD)` helper). Halo reach widened 22 → 26 px so the glow tail extends all the way to the slot edge. All eight shape painters (circle, charge, square, triangle, hexagon, diamond, star, needle) updated to use `softHalo(sdf, HALO_REACH)` in place of the old hard `band(...)` ring. Result: every bullet shape gets a smooth radial corona instead of a sharp colored ring.

- **`js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-renderer.js`** — Premultiplied additive blending: `gl.blendFuncSeparate(SRC_ALPHA, ONE, ONE, ONE)`. Overlapping bullets now sum their RGB instead of overwriting, so dense storm-needle volleys glow brighter than isolated shots. Fragment shader switched to a premultiplied composite (`bodyTint·G + white·B + hotTint·R`) with brightness pushed up — body multiplier 1.55 → 1.7, halo multiplier 2.2 → 2.6 with a `+0.25` floor so dark-tinted bullets still get a hot rim.

- **`css/styles.css`** — `#bulletCanvas` now uses `mix-blend-mode: screen` so the entire bullet layer lights up the underlying gameCanvas/glCanvas like a real light source. Empty pixels still pass through (RGB=0 means no screen contribution); bright bullet pixels brighten whatever's beneath. Combined with the additive within-layer blending, you get a true luminous bullet hell.

**What you'll see:** isolated bullets read as glowing energy projectiles with a soft corona. Dense fire (storm needles, multi-shot, scatter) saturates toward white-hot. Bullets crossing bright nebula regions stay visible because the screen blend brightens those pixels rather than fighting them.

---

## [5.79.58] - 2026-05-08

### Removed — Crit rush fire-rate buff
- **Removed the "crit feedback loop"** added in 5.75.0 — every critical hit was setting `player._critRushUntil = Date.now() + 800`, which then multiplied primary fire rate by 0.70 (30% faster) for 800 ms in `getEffectivePrimaryFireRate()`. Since the rate boost stacked multiplicatively with RAPID_FIRE and a high crit-chance build kept the timer constantly refreshed, this was a permanent ~30% DPS uplift on top of crit damage. Player was already strong enough.
- Removed call sites at `combat/collision-system.js:130` (asteroid hit) and `:549` (enemy hit). The enemy-hit branch retains the `checkMissionOnCrit()` mission tracker.
- Removed the fire-rate effect at `player/weapons.js:1305-1307`.
- Removed the visual cue (yellow pulse ring) at `player/renderer.js:33-51`.
- No leftover references; `_critRushUntil` field is no longer set or read anywhere.

---

## [5.79.57] - 2026-05-08

### Changed — Bullet rendering rewritten as energy-orb composite (no black outline)
The black-outline stroke pipeline (5.79.14 / 5.79.21 / 5.79.32 / 5.79.52 lineage) is gone. Player and enemy bullets now share one composite — saturated body, bright white core, hot-tinted halo rim — with no per-pool stroke tuning.

**Why:** The black outline was visually inconsistent across bullet sizes and pools. At the most recent tunings, player bullets read as too bold/thick at every `outlineScale` we tried (`0.55`, `0.35`), while enemy bullets read as having no visible stroke at all (the elongated `aspect=1.4` quad combined with mip-level selection thinned the rim ring to under a pixel along the long axis). Rather than chase per-pool calibration, the R channel of the bullet atlas is now interpreted as a **saturated halo glow** instead of a black mask. Same band shape in the atlas, fundamentally different visual.

**Shader composite (`js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-renderer.js`):**
- `color = bodyTint * G + white * B + brightTint * R`
  - `bodyTint = clamp(v_color.rgb * 1.55, 0, 1)` — saturated body
  - Top-left UV gloss adds a 3D ball feel (`v_uv` ramped against `(0.30, 0.30)`)
  - `brightTint = clamp(v_color.rgb * 2.2 + 0.15, 0, 1)` — over-saturated, white-hot rim
- Halo alpha is attenuated to `0.7×` of the body-vs-halo-only mask, so the rim falls off softly into the background instead of writing a solid colored ring.

**Atlas (`js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-atlas.js`):**
- R channel renamed `outline mask → halo mask`; `OUTLINE` constant kept as a legacy alias so the eight shape painters don't need rewrites.
- Comments updated throughout to reflect the new channel semantics.

**Per-instance plumbing simplified:**
- `FLOATS_PER_INSTANCE` 14 → 13 — the per-bullet `outlineScale` attribute is removed. There is no longer any per-pool stroke multiplier.
- `pushBullet(shape, x, y, size, color, alpha, angle, aspect)` — 8 args (was 9).
- Player bullet (`js/modules/player/bullet.js`) and enemy bullet (`js/modules/enemy/enemy-bullet.js`) call sites both drop the `outlineScale` argument.

**What's unchanged:** atlas slot layout, body/core radii, mipmap chain, bullet trail rendering (still Canvas2D), the WebGL2-or-fallback contract. Aspect=1.4 on enemy bullets stays (visual identity choice — elongates along travel direction).

---

## [5.79.56] - 2026-05-08

### Removed — Pass 3: Defense registry, gradient cache hardening, dead shop handlers
- **`js/modules/combat/defense-data.js` created** as the single source of truth for the eight defense items (`HEALTH_BOOST`, `SHIELD_BOOST`, `SPEED_BOOST`, `HEALTH_DROP_FREQUENCY`, `REFLEXES`, `LAST_STAND`, `STATIC_FIELD`, `SPARE_SHIP`). Schema: `id / name / description / icon / gradientColors / cost / maxStacks / flatCost`. Both `combat-manager.getPowerupConfig` (for in-game lookup) and the suspended `shopItems[]` (for when DEFENSE shop tab returns) read from this same registry — no more hand-mirrored copies that can drift.
- **Powerup-card gradient cache key hardened** in `world/powerup.js`. Previous key was `gradientColors[0] + '|' + gradientColors[1]` — fragile against gradients with 3+ stops. New key is `gradientColors.join('|')` so the cache disambiguates correctly regardless of gradient length.
- **Pause-tab HELP body refreshed** in `shop/shop-dom.js`. Old copy referenced removed shop tabs (DEFENSE-tab as SP-priced, "POWERUP PICKS" shop section); since the shop has been weapon-only since 5.78.0, that text was misleading. New copy: "Spend on the weapon-specific tabs above" + footer pointer to the in-pause POWERUPS tab.
- **Dead shop handlers removed** from `shop/shop-manager.js`: `_buildPowerupsTabItems`, `_buildSkillsTabItems`, `_handleSkillBuy`, `_handleWeaponBuyOrEquip` had been orphaned since 5.79.57's tab-builder rewrite. The `isWeapon`/`isSkill` dispatch branches in `buyShopItem` went with them.

## [5.79.55] - 2026-05-08

### Removed — Pass 2: Dead modules, getPowerupConfig consolidation, icon slug conversion
- **`js/modules/hud/index.js` deleted** — barrel re-export of HUD modules with zero importers anywhere in the codebase. Verified via grep before removal.
- **Seven unused performance modules deleted** from `js/modules/performance/`: `canvas-layers.js`, `frustum-culling.js`, `path-cache.js`, `render-batch.js`, `temporal-upsampling.js`, `text-cache.js`, `typed-array-particles.js`. All were class definitions (~1,250 LoC total) with zero `import` references. The active perf modules (e.g., `webgl-starfield-renderer.js`) are unaffected.
- **`combat/combat-manager.js#getPowerupConfig` consolidated** from a hand-mirrored 15-entry table into a 3-tier resolver: `POWERUP_TYPES` (offensive powerups, owned by `world/powerup.js`) → `DEFENSE_CONFIGS` (defense items, owned by the new `defense-data.js`) → weapon-data fallback (`PRIMARY_UPGRADES`/`POWER_UPGRADES`/`SKILL_UPGRADES`). Eliminates the drift surface where toast text and powerup-card text could disagree.
- **`displayName` field added** to all 10 `POWERUP_TYPES` entries in `world/powerup.js`. The short `name` (e.g., `'Rapid'`) keeps fitting on the powerup card, while `displayName` (e.g., `'Rapid Fire'`) is what `getPowerupConfig` returns for toast/log text — no need for the consumer to translate.
- **`POWERUP_TYPES` icons converted from emoji to slug strings** (`'⚡' → 'bolt'`, `'✳️' → 'multi-shot'`, etc.) to match the existing 79/79 weapon-data convention. Renders go through the same SVG-icon path that weapon icons already use.

## [5.79.54] - 2026-05-08

### Removed — Pass 1: Dead canvas-shop wrappers, arg-drop wrapper bug fix, dead shape branch
- **Four dead canvas-shop wrappers deleted** from `game-engine.js`: the `import * as shopRenderer` line plus the `drawShop` / `drawShopTabs` / `drawShopItem` / `drawMultilineText` wrappers. The shop is fully DOM-rendered (since 5.78.x); the canvas-shop module hadn't been called for some time but the wrappers were still keeping it loaded.
- **Wrapper arg-drop bug fixed** (3rd occurrence of this pattern in the codebase): `applyEnemyLevelScaling(enemy)` was dropping its `opts` parameter when forwarding to the wave module. Now `applyEnemyLevelScaling(enemy, opts = {}) { return wave.applyEnemyLevelScaling.call(this, enemy, opts); }`. Audited the entire wrapper surface in `game-engine.js` via a Python script — only this one bug found.
- **Dead `SHIELD_BOOST` octagon shape branch removed** from `world/powerup.js`. SHIELD_BOOST hasn't been an offensive-powerup type for a long time (it lives in DEFENSE_CONFIGS now), so the rendering branch in the powerup polygon switch was unreachable.
- **Dead `_buildSkillsTabItems`, `_buildPowerupsTabItems`, `_handleWeaponBuyOrEquip`, `_handleSkillBuy` wrappers removed** from `game-engine.js` (the corresponding shop-manager methods were also removed in pass 3).

---

## [5.79.43] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed — Hover-gradient flash on controls rows; section-title typography
- **Hover gradient flash fixed.** The previous fix (200%-background-size on each `<td>`) had the math right but visually flashed because each cell transitioned its `background` independently and the two cells repainted slightly out of sync. New approach: gradient lives on a `td::after` pseudo at full opacity from page load, hidden via `opacity: 0` at rest. On row hover, both pseudos transition `opacity: 0 → 1` in lockstep — opacity is GPU-accelerated and synchronized, so the two halves animate as one continuous sweep across the row.
- **Row dividers** moved from a separate `::after` pseudo to a plain `border-top` (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04)`) on the cells, freeing `::after` for the gradient. The fade-edge effect was lost but the row-spacing already provides enough separation.
- **Section-title font** swapped to Silkscreen (the project's other loaded pixel font) at 14 px. Uppercase, with a layered text-shadow: 1-px black outline (four-corner offsets) + an `accent-glow`-tinted soft halo at 10 px and 18 px radii. Pops against the glass backdrop while still reading as a pixel-art label.
- **Section bullet dot** removed — the SVG icon alone is enough as a section indicator. Both the JS render path (in `ui-manager.updateControlsTab`) and the `.controls-section-bullet` / `control-bullet-pulse` keyframes were dropped.

### Changed — Controls/Music tab text + mouse SVGs + Jumbo sprite swap
- **Power-weapon binding label** changed from "Fire / charge power weapon" → **"Fire Power Weapon"**. The "/charge" wording was misleading; the existing `weapons.js` charge logic already accumulates charge automatically over time (charging is gated by elapsed time since `chargeStartTime`, not by input being held), and pressing the input only triggers firing once minimum charge is met. Verified by reading the `if (powerConfig.isChargeBased)` branch — no input-gated charge accumulation existed.
- **Music tab** now has a `<h2>MUSIC</h2>` heading inside `#music-tab`, picking up the shared gold-gradient `title-sheen` styling. Was the only pause tab without a header.
- **Keyboard sprites** switched from Classic SimpleKeys (16-px-tall) to **Jumbo SimpleKeys (21-px-tall)**. `sprites/keys/*.png` was repopulated from `sprites/SimpleKeys/Jumbo/Dark/Single PNGs/`. CSS bumped: `.kbd` 48 → 63 px tall; `.kbd-sprite-text` 48 → 63 px / `min-width` 51 → 57 px (matches Jumbo `EMPTY1.png` at 3×); `.kbd-sprite-text.kbd-sprite-wide` `min-width` 117 → 123 px (matches Jumbo `EMPTY2.png` at 3×); `.kbd-sprite-small` 36 → 48 px.
- **L-Click / R-Click bindings** swapped from sprite-backed text tiles to inline mouse-silhouette SVGs (`new _buildMouseSvgKey(side)` in `ui-manager.js`). The renderer builds an original mouse-shaped silhouette via `createElementNS` — pear-shaped body, vertical divider between L/R buttons, horizontal divider between buttons and body, a tiny scroll-wheel rectangle at center, and the active button (left or right) filled with the accent color via `currentColor`. Cyan tone for L-Click, orange for R-Click; lift + accent-color drop-shadow on row hover.

## [5.79.41] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Tab-header gold gradient verified across all tabs; controls table dappered up
Per user request: gold-gradient header on every tab + dapper-yet-readable controls + obvious DYNAMIC markers.

- **All five pause-menu tabs** (CONTROLS, ASSISTS, PRIMARY WEAPON, POWER WEAPON, POWERUPS) now render their `<h2>` with the same shared Press Start 2P / 24 px / gold-gradient / tapered-underline treatment. Verified via Playwright smoke test on each tab's `getComputedStyle` — all five show the linear-gradient backgroundImage and the `title-sheen` animation.
- **Animated title shimmer** — the title gradient is now `200% × 100%` and slides 0 → 100 % background-position over 7 s in an `ease-in-out` loop (`@keyframes title-sheen`). Reads as polished metal catching light, not a flashy strobe.

**Dapper polish on the controls table:**
- **Accent dot prefix** in the action cell — 4-px dot in the section accent color, scales 1× → 1.4× and gains a soft glow on row hover. Subtle "you-are-here" cue without crowding the typography.
- **Hover lift** — hovered row's action cell shifts 4 px right (padding-left 18 → 22 px) and brightens to white, while the keys cell picks up a horizontal accent gradient. No layout reflow on neighbours.
- **Hairline row dividers** — built with `::after` pseudos that fade out at the column edges so they don't fight the rounded hover corners.
- **Refined typography** — action labels at Inter 15 px / 0.4-px tracking / 500 weight (was 0.3-px). Generous 12-px vertical padding. Color softened from `#f0f4fa` → `#d8e0ec` so brightening on hover reads as a state change, not just a color shift.
- **Larger card radius** — 14 px → 16 px; row corners 8 → 10 px so the rhythm scales with the new card.
- **Diagonal sheen ribbon** in the table corner (already present in 5.79.40) stays.

**Index.html cleanup — explicit DYNAMIC markers:**
- The PRIMARY / POWER / POWERUPS tabs now carry `<!-- ▼ DYNAMIC: ui-manager.update*Tab() owns the children of #...-list -->` comments above the dynamic containers, so it's obvious at a glance which markup is JS-owned and which is static.
- Inline `style="..."` attributes on those tab containers and the "Click a weapon to equip it" subtitle were lifted to semantic CSS classes (`.pause-tab-subtitle`, `.pause-tab-list`, `.pause-tab-list--scroll`).
- `<h2 style="text-align: center;">POWERUPS</h2>` lost its inline center because the shared `.pause-tab-content > h2` rule already centers the title — this allowed the gold-gradient to apply uniformly without inline-style specificity wars.

### Body-copy font review
Action labels stay in Inter at 15 px (0.4-px tracking, weight 500). Section titles at 13 px (2.8-px tracking, uppercase, weight 700, accent-tinted). Subtitle copy at 12 px italic (`.pause-tab-subtitle`). Press Start 2P is now used **only** for the page header — every body-copy element on the controls page renders in a system-readable font.

---

## [5.79.40] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed — Controls tab sprites finally show up; rebuilt as a proper table
**Root cause of "why aren't the keyboard sprites integrated and working?"** — `ui-manager.updateControlsTab()` was rewriting the entire `#controls-tab` innerHTML with the legacy text-based `<span class="control-symbol">WASD</span>` markup *every time the pause menu opened*, blowing away the sprite-based HTML I had been adding to `index.html` over the past several patches. Static markup → JS overwrites → user sees text.

Fix: stripped the static controls block from `index.html` (now just an empty `<div id="controls-tab">`) and rewrote `updateControlsTab()` from scratch as a programmatic table builder driven by a single declarative `sections` array. Each section is `{ name, accent, iconPath, rows: [{ action, keys: [...] }] }`. Each key entry is one of `{ kind: 'sprite' | 'text' | 'or' | 'wasd' }`. Built with `createElement` / `appendChild` (and `createElementNS` for the SVG icon, no `innerHTML`).

### Changed — Controls page redesigned as a dapper two-column table
Per user request: action on the left, key binding (SimpleKeys sprites) on the right.

- **Table layout** — `<table class="controls-table">` with section header rows (`colspan=2`) and data rows. Borders collapse with 4-px row spacing. Backdrop is glass-morphism (`backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(130%)`) over a radial gold-tint gradient. Inset highlights + drop-shadow + a 1-px ring for depth. A diagonal sheen ribbon (`::before`) gives the corner a subtle reflective highlight.
- **Per-section accents** — Movement = cyan, Combat = orange, Loadout = pink, System = gold. Drives the section icon color, animated bullet, and the row hover stripe.
- **Hover state** — row lights up with a horizontal gradient that fades from the section's accent color to white-tinted; `inset 3px 0` accent stripe on the action cell. No layout shift; the gradient makes each row feel distinct without crowding.
- **Section header** — SVG icon (built via `createElementNS`) + animated 6-px bullet (1× → 1.4× pulse @ 2.4 s) + uppercase Inter title at 13 px / 2.8-px tracking, all in the section accent color with `drop-shadow` glow.
- **Footer hint** — `[ESC] to resume play` line below the table with the same sprite-backed text tile.

### Changed — Pause-menu tab headers now share a gold-gradient title style
All `.pause-tab-content > h2` elements (CONTROLS, ASSISTS, PRIMARY WEAPON, POWER WEAPON, POWERUPS, MUSIC, etc.) now render with:
- Press Start 2P at 24 px / 5-px letter-spacing
- A `linear-gradient(180deg, #fff7d6, #FFC107, #cf8b00)` text-clip
- A 20-px gold halo `text-shadow`
- A tapered horizontal underline (`::after`) — fades from transparent → gold → bright gold → gold → transparent, with a 10-px glow

The legacy `.pause-tab-content h2` rule (descendant selector with `font-size: 28px`) was reduced to a `margin-top: 0` reset so it no longer overrides the gradient styling.

### Body-copy font readability
- Action labels: Inter 15 px / 500 weight / 0.3-px tracking.
- Section titles: Inter 13 px / 700 weight / 2.8-px tracking, uppercase, accent color.
- "or" separator: Inter 12 px italic, dim gray.
- Press Start 2P is now reserved for the page header only — body copy is fully readable system font.

---

## [5.79.39] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed — HUD button labels now fit cleanly inside the squares
Bottom-center HUD buttons (`SHOP` / `STATS` / `PAUSE`) had labels that visually overlapped the bottom border. Two issues:
- The label was rendered with the previous `textBaseline = 'middle'` left over from the icon block, which placed text vertically off where I intended.
- Button height (56 px) didn't leave a clean strip for the label below the icon.

Reworked layout in `js/modules/hud/hud-buttons.js`:
- Button size 64×56 → **72×64**.
- Icon centered at 36 % of button height (top portion) instead of `center − 5 px`.
- Label uses explicit `textBaseline = 'bottom'` and sits at `y + h − 7`, fully inside the 8-px corner radius.
- Icon size 28 → 26 px so it doesn't crowd the label slot.

### Changed — Controls page modernized; sprite-backed ESC + Mouse keys
Per user request (cooler, more modern + readable fonts + sprite-styled non-letter keys):

- **Glass-morphism cards** with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px) saturate(120%)` and a layered hairline border via a `::before` linear-gradient mask. Per-section accent palette: Movement = cyan, Combat = orange, Loadout = pink, System = gold.
- **SVG section icons** drawn from the icon registry (`shield` / `target` / `bolt` / `pause`) prefixed before each section title, glowing in the section's accent color via `drop-shadow`.
- **Animated section bullet** — 6-px dot pulsing 1× → 1.4× over 2.4 s (`@keyframes control-bullet-pulse`).
- **CONTROLS header** is the only piece still using `Press Start 2P`, now with a gold gradient text-clip and a soft 18-px halo. Section titles, action labels, mouse buttons, and ESC tile all use Inter.
- **`kbd-sprite-text` class** — uses `EMPTY1.png` / `EMPTY2.png` as a CSS background image (`image-rendering: pixelated`) so the ESC, Mouse, L-Click, R-Click tiles share the SimpleKeys pixel-art aesthetic with the actual sprite keys instead of standing out as DOM rectangles. Tonal variants `kbd-tone-cyan` / `kbd-tone-orange` keep the L/R-click color coding.
- **Hover micro-anim** — keys lift 1 px and pick up a subtle white drop-shadow when their row is hovered.
- **Footer hint** — `[ESC] to resume play` line below the grid, dashed-border separator, references the same sprite-backed key tile so the page feels cohesive.

## [5.79.38] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Health orbs all 3D, gold shapes all 2D (visual distinction)
- **Health orbs** (`color-star.js`) now pick exclusively from 3D solids — `cube`, `octahedron`, `tetrahedron`, `prism`. Was a mixed pool of 2D and 3D shapes; now every health orb tumbles as a recognizable solid.
- **Rotation speed** lowered for 3D health orbs from 0.06–0.16 rad/tick (3.6–9.6 rad/s @ 60Hz, "too fast" per user) to **0.025–0.055** (1.5–3.3 rad/s) — slow enough to read each face turning, fast enough to never look frozen.
- **Gold shapes** (`gold-shape.js`) now pick exclusively from 2D silhouettes — `star4`, `star5`, `star6`, `star8`, `hexagon`, `diamond`, `triangle`. Dropped the 3D solids from the pool. Pairs with the health-orb change so the two pickups read as visually distinct: flat geometric coin-shapes (gold) vs. tumbling solid orbs (health).

## [5.79.37] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Emoji icons replaced with SVG vector paths; Controls page restructured

**Emoji → SVG transition** (per `docs/Emoji to SVG Transition – 2026-05-07.md`):

- New module `js/modules/ui/icons.js` — registry of **53 hand-authored SVG paths** (24×24 viewBox, `currentColor` fill) keyed by slug, plus a **54-entry emoji → slug map** for legacy compatibility.
- Two render helpers:
    - `renderIconHTML(input, opts)` — returns inline `<svg>` markup for DOM `innerHTML` consumers.
    - `getIconImage(input, sizePx, color)` — returns a cached `HTMLCanvasElement` rasterized once per `(slug, size, color)` tuple, ready for `ctx.drawImage()` on Canvas2D consumers.
    - `resolveIconSlug(input)` accepts either an emoji glyph or a slug and returns the canonical slug (or null) — half-migrated codebases stay safe.
- **104 emoji icon definitions** rewritten to slug strings across `combat-manager.js`, `weapon-data.js`, `shop-manager.js`, `shop-dom.js`.
- **9 render call sites** wired through the new helpers with text-fallback branches: `ui-manager.js` (weapon list, powerup overlay), `shop-dom.js` (equipped banners, item tiles), `world/powerup.js` (floating powerup pickup), `hud/combat.js` (powerup pickup banner + HUD circle), `hud/status.js` (PRM/PWR/SKILL squares), `hud/hud-buttons.js` (SHOP/STATS/PAUSE bottom bar), `hud/overlays.js` (circular wave-spawn timer), `ui/radial-menu.js` (radial weapon picker).
- The legacy `shop-renderer.js` (canvas shop, marked unused) is left untouched.

**Controls page restructured (5.79.37 polish, follows 5.79.35 sprite work):**

- Layout split into themed cards: **Movement / Combat / Loadout / System** instead of a single dense list. Cards arrange in a responsive grid (auto-fit, `minmax(360px, 1fr)`), so the controls reflow naturally in the pause overlay.
- Each card has a goldenrod border + inset-glow + drop shadow, lifts on hover with a stronger glow, and a small gold bullet next to a `Press Start 2P` section title.
- **Body copy now uses Inter / system-ui** at 15 px instead of Press Start 2P at 1.25 rem — the pixel font was illegible at body sizes. Section titles + key tiles (`.kbd`, `.kbd-mouse`, `.kbd-text`) keep the pixel-styled treatment so the gameplay identity survives.
- Action labels are now sentence-case and slightly more verbose ("Move ship", "Aim reticle", "Fire / charge power weapon") — the freed-up readability budget pays for clearer copy.
- SimpleKeys pixel-art sprites and WASD diamond layout preserved from 5.79.35.

## [5.79.36] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold drops drift freely; magnet only triggers when player is near
5.79.34 restored the full three-tier magnet (constant base pull at any range + medium proximity + close-range snap), but the user wanted drops to actually drift in space — not stream toward the player from across the screen. Removed Tier 1 (the always-on base pull) from both `gold-coin.js` and `gold-shape.js`. Drops now:

- **Drift** on their initial scatter velocity, decaying through `0.92` friction with the gentle wobble for residual motion.
- Sit motionless when far from the player — no auto-pull.
- Magnetize **only when the player gets within 100 px** (`MAGNET_MID_RANGE`); the medium-range pull ramps up as proximity tightens.
- Snap into the player at ≤ 40 px (`MAGNET_NEAR_RANGE`) — the "scoop" tier.
- Tractor beam still works at long range as the player's active vacuum tool.

Reads as: drops scatter, settle in space, and the player has to actually move close (or use tractor) to collect them. The original "fly within a screen-width and watch them fly toward you" homing is gone.

---

## [5.79.35] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Controls page redesigned with pixel-art key sprites; SFX files renamed
- **Controls tab in the pause menu** now renders each input as a SimpleKeys pixel-art sprite (sourced from `sprites/SimpleKeys/Classic/Dark/Single PNGs/`, copied to `sprites/keys/` for clean URL paths). Each row is now a flex track `[input cluster] [chevron] [action]` with the cluster columns aligned so chevrons line up vertically. WASD renders as a 2-row diamond (W on top, A/S/D below); arrow keys render as a 4-key cluster; mouse buttons get pixel-styled `kbd-mouse` cards in cyan / orange to match the L/R click colors used elsewhere in the HUD. Hover lifts each row 4 px and tints the background goldenrod for a tactile feel. CSS-side: `image-rendering: pixelated` keeps the 16-px sprites crisp at 3× scale.
- **`sfx/Laser_Beam_Weapon_Active.mp3` → `sfx/laserBeamLoop.mp3`** and **`sfx/thunderous_lightning_laser.mp3` → `sfx/arcLightningLoop.mp3`**. Both files were dropped into the project with verbose snake_case names that didn't match the camelCase convention used by every other file in `sfx/` (e.g. `arcStrike1.wav`, `laserBeamHit1.wav`). Renamed to match. `audio-manager.js` updated to reference the new filenames; their stale duplicate copies in the project root were removed.

## [5.79.34] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed — Magnetism restored on gold drops
The 5.79.32 rework moved gold pickups out of `colorStarPool` into independent `GoldCoin` / `GoldShape` classes — but the new classes only had drift + tractor pull, no homing magnet. Result: every gold drop had to be picked up by flying directly into it, which the user reported felt much worse than the original behavior.

Restored the **three-tier homing magnet** in both `gold-coin.js` and `gold-shape.js` (independent copies — the classes stay decoupled per the user's earlier request):

| Tier | Range | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (base) | any distance | `0.8 × 0.15 × Z` (constant pull) |
| 2 (medium) | ≤ 100 px | `15 × (100 − dist)/100 × Z` (proximity-scaled) |
| 3 (snap) | ≤ 40 px | `25 × (40 − dist)/40 × Z` (magnetic snap) |

`Z = 2.5` (mid-range default — the legacy code used per-orb depth `1.5–3.0`, but gold drops aren't depth-stratified so a fixed value is correct). Tractor boost still stacks on top when engaged.

Friction lowered from `0.985` → `0.92` to match the pre-rework `ORB_FRIC`. Without that change the magnet's velocity additions accumulate to absurd speeds (steady-state at base pull would be ~1200 px/s instead of ~225 px/s).

Live test: drops spawned 200 px from the player show negative-x velocity bias within 10 ticks, moving 15-20 px toward the player in 166 ms. In-game collision (radius ~32 px, swept) catches drops before any overshoot.

---

## [5.79.33] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Pickup polish: blue health sparkles, scanline-skip for orbs, pixel-sharp gold coins

- **Health pickup sparkles are now blue.** The 8-sparkle ring + central blip on health-orb collect was hardcoded `#FFFF00` (gold) for ALL collectibles, popping a yellow burst on the blue orb. Now branches by `starType`: health → cyan-blue (`#33ddff` blip + `#66e6ff` sparkles), money/legacy → original gold.
- **Orbs (health, gold shape, gold coin) skip the WebGL CRT scanlines.** Added a per-instance `a_noScan` attribute (slot 14 in the 16-float instance layout) that's set to 1 for collectibles in `_pushOrbInstance`. The fragment shader does `mix(scan, 1.0, v_noScan)` so orbs render at full brightness while the starfield + nebula behind them keep the scanline effect. Reads as "game objects on top of CRT background" instead of "tinted dressing".
- **Gold coins render as pixel-sharp `fillRect` squares on Canvas2D**, bypassing the WebGL atlas entirely. The atlas-baked dot has a Gaussian-falloff core that made coins look like glowy specks even after the shader-side halo was killed. New `_drawGoldCoinsCanvas2D` draws each coin as a 1-3 px hard square (sized by `radius`), `imageSmoothingEnabled = false`, no antialiasing, no halo, no Gaussian blur. Gold shapes still ride the WebGL pipeline (their geometric silhouettes need atlas sampling).
- A `a_sharp` attribute (slot 15 in the instance layout) was added in case the WebGL path needs to disable the halo per-instance later (e.g. for any other "crisp dot" cases). Currently unused since coins moved to Canvas2D, but the plumbing stays.

---

## [5.79.32] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold pickups rebuilt as independent floating drops; `createColorStarBurst` deleted
Major rework of the pickup layer driven by user feedback that drops still felt cluttered with rotating geometry:

**`createColorStarBurst` removed entirely.** The function spawned 5 decorative shape stars (cubes / octahedra / star8 / etc., picked from `STAR_SHAPES`) at every asteroid/enemy kill location. Their assigned velocities were dead code — decorative stars ignore `vel.x/y` in update — so the 5 stars just sat at the kill point, visually identical to gold geometry. Combined with the gold drop's shape orb, drops looked like ~6 spinning shapes per kill. All three call sites in `collision-system.js` removed and the function deleted from `combat-manager.js`.

**Gold pickups split into two new independent classes** (`js/modules/world/gold-coin.js`, `js/modules/world/gold-shape.js`), each with its own self-contained motion + lifetime + render fields. They no longer live in `colorStarPool` or share code:

- `GoldCoin` — pure dot, 1.5-3 px gold pixel. Many spawn per drop (6-30 via splitter). No rotation, no shape variation, just a dot.
- `GoldShape` — chunky geometric piece, 8-16 px. One per drop. Picks from a pool of stars / hexagons / cubes / octahedra / etc.

Both classes drift in space with high friction (0.985) plus a slow per-instance wobble. **No homing magnet** — the player must fly into them or pull them with the tractor beam. **120-second lifetime** with a 5-second blink in the last 5s and a smooth fade in the last 0.5s.

**Health orbs** (still in `colorStarPool` since they're the only collectible left there) also drift instead of homing now. Friction lowered from `ORB_FRIC` (0.92) to 0.985, three-tier homing magnet removed, lifetime bumped 1800 → 7200 ticks (30s → 120s).

**Health orb size** trimmed from 12-30 px to **8-16 px** so it matches the gold shape size; the blue color is enough to differentiate it from gold.

**Bullet outline** (`webgl-bullet-atlas.js`) bumped from 12 to 22 atlas px (and `BODY_R` 42 → 38 to give the wider outline room). On enemy bullets — which render at aspect=1.4, thinning the outline along the long axis — the stroke went from ~1.2 screen px to ~3 px, matching the perceptual weight of player bullets.

### Removed
- `combat-manager.createColorStarBurst()` and the `game-engine.createColorStarBurst()` wrapper.
- 1-or-2-shape gating in `_splitMoneyDrop` (5.79.31 already forced 1, but the old "≥100g → 2" branch is now physically gone).

---

## [5.79.31] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed — One homing geometry piece per gold drop, plus the explosive-splash bypass
Two compounding bugs were making gold drops feel cluttered with chunky geometry:

1. **The splitter still allowed 2 shape orbs.** Drops with budget ≥100g produced two chunky homing pieces stacked at the kill point. Lowered to **exactly 1 shape orb per drop, always.**
2. **Explosive bullet AOE bypassed the splitter entirely.** `dropStarsFromEntity` (the legacy splash-kill path used by `bullet.js` explode()) was spawning a fresh chunky shape orb per AOE kill. With a 4-enemy splash that meant 4 extra chunky orbs piled on top of the primary kill's drop. Rerouted to spawn a small **floating pixel-coin shower instead** — no chunky homing piece on splash, since the primary kill already provides one.

Side-by-side on the splitter:

| | 5.79.30 | **5.79.31** |
|---|---|---|
| Shape orbs per drop | 1 (small) or 2 (≥100g) | **1, always** |
| Shape MAX size | 24 px | **16 px** |
| Shape value cap | 50g | **80g** (single shape carries more) |
| Pixel size MIN/MAX | 1.0 / 2.0 px | **1.5 / 3.0 px** (visible as coins) |
| Pixel count cap | 15 | **30** |
| Pixel count divisor | budget / 5 (min 4) | **budget / 4 (min 6)** |
| Splash AOE drop | chunky shape orb per kill | **5-pixel coin shower per kill** |

Net result: every drop reads as one homing chunky coin surrounded by a clear shower of floating pixel coins, regardless of weapon. No more piles of geometry from explosive AOE.

---

## [5.79.30] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold pixel particles now just float, no homing
The 1-2 px gold "glimmer" particles spawned alongside each shape orb no longer feed into the three-tier homing magnet that pulls collectibles toward the player. They:

- Scatter on their initial drop velocity (`random(2, 5)` px/frame, wide angle).
- Decay through `ORB_FRIC` (0.92 per tick), settling to nearly stationary in ~1-2 seconds.
- Stay where they settle. The player has to **fly into them** to collect — they don't auto-stream into the ship.

The **tractor beam still works on pixels** (and uses full strength `k = 1.0` instead of the `0.55` health-orb scale), so the player has a sweep tool when they want to vacuum up the floating coin scatter without flying through every glimmer individually.

Shape orbs (gold and health) keep the original three-tier magnet — they snap to the player as before. Only the pixel particles got the "free-floating" treatment, which matches their visual role: subtle background glimmer scattered around the chunky orb you actually fly toward.

---

## [5.79.29] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold drops are now MUCH subtler
Per user feedback, gold drops still felt cluttered. Pared down further on every axis:

| | 5.79.28 | **5.79.29** |
|---|---|---|
| Shape gate (1 vs 2) | <60g → 1, else 2 | **<100g → 1, else 2** |
| Shape size MAX | 28 px | **24 px** |
| Pixel size MIN/MAX | 1.8 / 4.2 px | **1.0 / 2.0 px** |
| Pixel count cap | 30 | **15** |
| Pixel count divisor | budget / 3 | **budget / 5** |

Now most drops show **1 chunky shape orb + 4-10 tiny 1-2 px glimmers**; only big payday drops (≥100g) get a second shape. A maxed-out drop tops out at 17 visible entities (was 32). Pixel particles really are 1-2 px gold sparks now — they read as a faint scatter of glimmers around the shape, not a swarm.

Drop entity counts:

| Budget | Shapes | Pixels | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10g | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 30g | 1 | 4 | 5 |
| 60g | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| 100g | 2 | 10 | 12 |
| 150g | 2 | 15 | 17 |
| 250g (cap) | 2 | 15 | 17 |

Runaway-gold defense is unchanged: `MONEY_ORB_DROP_BUDGET_MAX = 250` still caps total per-drop budget regardless of multiplier compound.

---

## [5.79.28] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold drop: at most 2 shape orbs (was up to 3)
Per user feedback, big gold drops were spawning too many large geometry shapes — three chunky tumbling 3D solids was visually too much. The shape-orb cap is now **2** universally. Small drops (<60g) get 1 chunky shape; everything else gets exactly 2. The remainder of the budget always pours into the pixel coin shower, so a big drop reads as "two big tumbling shapes surrounded by a wide spray of gold dots."

To make the fewer shapes carry more visual weight, shape-orb max radius bumped 22 → 28 px. A maxed-value shape orb now renders at ~42 px on screen, big enough to feel like *the* prize amid the surrounding pixel scatter.

| Constant | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| shape-orb count cap | 3 | **2** |
| `MONEY_ORB_SHAPE_SIZE_MIN` | 8 | **10** |
| `MONEY_ORB_SHAPE_SIZE_MAX` | 22 | **28** |

### Changed — Coin pickup chime is now a richer 4-layer ka-ching
The old coin sound was a 3-layer crystalline tinkle — clear but thin, no body. Reworked into a fuller bell stack:

1. **BODY** — sub-octave sine bell, 0.55s decay, with `p_env_punch: 0.45`. Adds low-end weight under the fundamental and a sharp front transient.
2. **ROOT** — clear sine "ding" with rising pitch sweep + arp; this is the main note the player hears.
3. **FIFTH** — perfect-fifth harmonic (square + vibrato) above ROOT for bell shimmer without dominating.
4. **SPARKLE** — high arp tail with HPF, the "tinkle" finish.

Each layer's decay extended slightly so the chime rings out instead of cutting off cleanly — pickups now feel rewarding rather than clinical.

Also bumped the coin-name throttle 50 ms → **70 ms** so a 30-orb pixel coin shower played in <1s reads as distinct chimes instead of piling into a buzz.

---

## [5.79.27] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold drops are now a few shape orbs + a coin shower of pixel particles
A single gold drop event now spawns **1-3 chunky shape orbs** (varying values up to 50g each) and **6-30 tiny pixel particles** that scatter outward at higher velocity. Both kinds remain collectible — the player scoops everything up — but visually a kill drop reads as "a couple of fancy orbs surrounded by a glittering shower of coins" instead of "N uniform orbs of the same size."

| Constant | Old (5.79.26) | New |
|---|---|---|
| `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MIN` / `_MAX` (single tier) | 4 / 14 | *removed* |
| `MONEY_ORB_SHAPE_SIZE_MIN` | — | **8** |
| `MONEY_ORB_SHAPE_SIZE_MAX` | — | **22** |
| `MONEY_ORB_SHAPE_VALUE_MAX` | — | **50** |
| `MONEY_ORB_PIXEL_SIZE_MIN` / `_MAX` | — | **1.8 / 4.2** |
| `MONEY_ORB_PIXEL_COUNT_MAX` | — | **30** |
| `MONEY_ORB_DROP_BUDGET_MAX` | — | **250** |
| `MONEY_ORB_MAX_MONEY_PER_ORB` / `_MAX_DROP_COUNT` | 15 / 25 | *removed* |

The `MONEY_ORB_DROP_BUDGET_MAX = 250` is a hard ceiling on per-drop budget, replacing the old `_splitBudgetIntoOrbs` cap-times-count clamp. Even with the 5.79.26 multiplier compound delivering a 12,000g intent, the actual drop now caps at **250g of pickups** — same defense against the runaway-gold bug, just expressed at the budget level instead of inside the splitter.

### Changed — Health drops are now exactly one shape orb
Health was previously split via `_splitBudgetIntoOrbs` into up to 6 orbs per drop (gated by streak/level multipliers). Now: **one orb per drop event**, sized by heal amount (level-scaled formula in `createHealthOrb`). Range bumped from 9-28 px → 12-30 px so the blue health pickup reads as "the big important one" against the surrounding gold coin shower. The drop cooldown (60s base, 30s minimum) is unchanged.

### Added — 3D shapes (cube/octahedron/tetrahedron/prism) on orbs, with fast tumble
The orb shape pool now includes the WebGL atlas's four 3D solids, alongside the existing 2D shapes (`star4`, `star5`, `star6`, `star8`, `hexagon`, `diamond`, `triangle`). Both gold shape orbs AND health orbs can roll any of these. Orb rotation rates were bumped 4-8× faster than decorative stars so the 3D shapes tumble visibly (3D shapes specifically get an extra speed bump because their atlas-baked internal edges only "read" as a tumbling solid at speed) — the "interesting rotation" the user asked for. Stroke overlays on canvas-2D are skipped for 3D shapes so the atlas's baked edges aren't fighting a circle stroke.

### Internal
- New `createMoneyOrb(x, y, amount, isPixel)` flag selects between the chunky-shape and tiny-pixel branches. Pixel orbs force `shape='dot'`, override radius to 1.8-4.2 px, skip the canvas-2D stroke and magnet halo, and *do not emit shimmer particles* (one drop = up to 30 pixel orbs; without this guard, sparkle emission alone would saturate the particle pool).
- Pixel orbs spawn with a wider scatter speed (`random(2,5)` vs `random(1,3)` for shapes), giving the "shower" silhouette before the magnet pulls everything in.
- `_splitBudgetIntoOrbs` removed; replaced by `_splitMoneyDrop` (returns `{ shapes, pixels }`) and a `_evenSplit` helper. `HEALTH_ORB_MAX_DROP_COUNT` removed — single orb per drop.
- `is3DShape` flag set in `ColorStar.reset()` based on the chosen shape; consumed by `drawOrbOverlay` (skip stroke) and the rotation-speed pick (extra bump for 3D).

---

## [5.79.26] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed — Runaway gold per kill at late waves
**Root cause**: `_splitBudgetIntoOrbs` was documented to *intentionally* overshoot the per-orb cap when budget exceeded `cap × maxOrbs`. The cap (`MONEY_ORB_MAX_MONEY_PER_ORB = 100`) was supposed to limit per-orb value, but the splitter would inflate each orb's value past the cap if the budget was huge — clamping orb count, not orb value. Combined with six compounding multipliers in `dropOrbsFromEntity` (`baseCount × levelQuantityMultiplier × enemyQuantityMultiplier × hitStreakMultiplier × goldFindMultiplier × streakGoldMult`, product ~35× at peak with a 60-kill streak at wave 20), a single kill could deliver 12,000+ gold packed into 6 oversized orbs.

The splitter now CLAMPS total budget to `cap × maxOrbs` before splitting. Excess is discarded — the per-orb value stays bounded at the cap, so combined with the constants below the worst-case single-kill payout is now **375 gold instead of unbounded** (96.9% reduction in the worst case).

Not a floating-point issue. It was a multiplicative compounding pile and a documented "feature" that effectively defeated the per-orb cap.

### Fixed — Late-wave SP runaway
**Same shape, different mechanic**. SP comes from level-ups (+1/level). Enemy points scale 6.5× by wave 20 (`ptsMul = 1 + ((L-1)/19)^1.4 × 5.5`), and XP is `ceil(points / 3)` per kill — so a wave-20 kill grants ~430 XP. The XP-to-next curve was linear at `200 + (level-1) × 50` (5.79.16), giving 1150 XP at L20. That meant 2-3 kills per level at late waves → 8-10 levels per wave → 8-10 SP per wave on top of the wave-clear bonus.

XP curve now grows as a power: `experienceToNextLevel = floor(50 × level^1.45)`. New cost at L20 is 3850 (vs old 1150 — 3.3× steeper); at L30 it's 6930 (vs old 1650 — 4.2× steeper). Gain rate stays meaningful at low levels (L5: 515 vs old 400) but late-wave SP no longer compounds into a runaway pile.

### Changed — Gold orbs are now a coin shower (per user request)
Big payday drops now spawn 20+ tiny coins instead of 6 chunky orbs. Per-orb cap dropped from 100g to 15g and the drop count cap raised from 6 to 25 — combined with the now-enforced `_splitBudgetIntoOrbs` ceiling, this gives a "scoop up the coin shower" feel instead of a "grab the fat orb" feel.

| Constant | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MIN` | 8 | **4** |
| `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MAX` | 38 | **14** |
| `MONEY_ORB_MAX_MONEY_PER_ORB` | 100 | **15** |
| `MONEY_ORB_MAX_DROP_COUNT` | 6 | **25** |

A 1g coin renders at 4×1.5 = 6 px (a tiny speck); a 15g coin renders at 14×1.5 = 21 px (a small coin). Health orb sizes (9-28 px) are unchanged on purpose — they stay visibly larger than the gold coin shower so the player can distinguish "scoop the coins" from "grab the bigger blue orb" at a glance.

---

## [5.79.25] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Orb size scales more dramatically with amount delivered
Both pickup orbs already mapped value linearly to size, but the ranges were narrow enough that the dependence wasn't visually obvious. Widened the size constants so the smallest orbs read as pocket-change pickups and the biggest as chunky payloads.

| Constant | Old | New | Ratio (max ÷ min) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_MIN` | 14 | 9 | 3.1× (was 1.7×) |
| `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_MAX` | 24 | 28 | |
| `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MIN` | 14 | 8 | 4.75× (was 2.1×) |
| `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MAX` | 30 | 38 | |

A 1-heal orb is now visibly tiny next to a 2-heal orb; a 10g pickup is a small coin while a 100g orb is a fat chunky pickup.

### Removed — Dead orb fields and unused renderer state
Cleanup pass after the WebGL orb redesign in 5.79.24 left several fields and a wasted compute on the orb spawn path. None of these were read anywhere after the canvas-2D `drawDirect` and `drawDirectSimple` paths were deleted in 5.79.24.

- **`points`** and **`innerRadiusRatio`** on `ColorStar` — set in `reset()` but never read by any draw path.
- **`pulseOffset`** and **`pulseSpeed`** on `ColorStar` — set in `reset()` and incremented in `update()` but never read; the orb shimmer is now driven by `twinkleSpeed`/`twinklePhase` (read by both the WebGL shader and `drawOrbOverlay`).
- **`sizeMultiplier`** on orbs — set to 1 in `combat-manager.createHealthOrb`/`createMoneyOrb` but no draw or render code reads it. The `sizeVariation` pin to 1 (which the WebGL push and stroke overlay both read) is what actually disables size jitter for orbs.
- **Wasted z-based `baseRadius` compute** for orbs in `ColorStar.reset()` — `combat-manager` overwrites both `radius` and `baseRadius` immediately after with the amount-derived size, so the parallax-z formula was throwaway work. Replaced with a conservative fallback (`radius = 14`) for the off-path case where an orb spawns without going through the combat helpers.

## [5.79.24] - 2026-05-07

### Changed — Gold and health orbs now look like stars (WebGL)
Both pickup orbs were redesigned to read as glittering star variants instead of the old "circle with $ sign" / "green diamond" treatment. Each orb at spawn picks a random shape from the WebGL starfield's pool — `star4`, `star5`, `star6`, `star8`, `hexagon`, `diamond`, or `triangle` — and renders through the same instanced WebGL pipeline that draws the background starfield. The orb body is GPU-rendered with the per-orb color, twinkle phase, twinkle speed, and rotation rate, giving orbs the same shimmer the field stars already had. A thin canvas-2D stroke + magnet-pulse halo overlays the WebGL body for a hard outline against bright nebula, and a `starSparkle` particle is emitted every ~140-230 ms inside each orb's silhouette so they read as actively glimmering on the playfield.

- **Health orb color → bright blue** (`#00aaff`), matching the high-HP gradient of the health bar (was `#00ff7f` green).
- **Money orb color → unchanged** at `#FFD700` gold; symbol overlay (`$`/`¥`/`£`/`€`) is gone — the orb's silhouette and color carry the read.
- **Sparkle particle** types accept optional radius + color args so the existing `starSparkle` slot can carry both the gold and blue shimmer.

### Internal
- `WebGLStarfieldRenderer` gains `setBaseline()` + `resetTransients()`. The instance buffer is partitioned into a permanent prefix (background stars, nebula, decorative color stars) seeded once at init, and a transient suffix repopulated each frame for moving orbs. Single instanced draw call still covers everything.
- `_pushOrbsToWebGL()` runs each frame between `_flushStarfieldIfDirty()` and `starfieldRenderer.draw()`, walking the active color-star pool and submitting one transient instance per orb at parallax 0.
- `ColorStar.update()` now takes a `particlePool` argument and emits the periodic shimmer sparkle from the orb's interior.
- `ColorStar.drawOrbOverlay()` replaces the old `drawDirect` body draw for orbs — only the stroke ring + magnet pulse stay on canvas-2D; the orb fill is GPU-rendered.
- `setBaseline()` is called from BOTH `init()` and the title-screen `start()`. The title screen pre-populates the starfield via its own path (not through `init()`), so it needed its own baseline lock to keep `resetTransients()` from rewinding the buffer to 0 and rendering the title screen as a black void.

## [5.79.23] - 2026-05-06

Three bundled changes per user request: small fancy stars come back, beams move to the power slot, and the beam-DPS spillover for primary upgrades is gone now that the beams are no longer primaries.

### Changed — Fancy stars limited to small sizes
Small stars can pick from the full geometric / multi-point / 3D pool again (`STAR_SHAPES`). Big stars are restricted to a new `BIG_STAR_SHAPES = ['point', 'circle']` list — no more giant cubes, octahedrons, multi-point bursts, or geometric chunks parading across the playfield. The WebGL force-redirect override added in 5.79.22 is removed; the slot mapping is back to its original 1-to-1 form. Lens-flare stars stay disabled.

### Changed — Lance Beam and Arc Lightning are now POWER weapons
Both beams (`LANCE_BEAM`, `LIGHTNING_ARC`) moved from `PRIMARY_WEAPONS` to `POWER_WEAPONS`. They're cooldown-based: trigger fires the beam for `beamDuration` (3s default), then waits out `cooldown` (8s) before re-activation. The continuous-tether feel is preserved during the active window, but the beam now occupies the power slot like the other heavy weapons. Beam upgrades (`BEAM_WIDTH`, `LINGER`, `REFRACTION`, `OVERLOAD_BEAM`, `LANCE_VELOCITY`, `TRIPLE_BEAM`, `AMPLIFIER`, `ARC_OVERCHARGE`) moved from `PRIMARY_UPGRADES` to `POWER_UPGRADES` accordingly.

This frees the primary slot for projectile weapons exclusively (Pulse Cannon, Storm Needles, Scatter Shot, Rail Driver), and lets a player run a projectile primary alongside a beam power weapon — a combination the old slotting forbade.

### Removed — Beam-DPS spillover for bullet-flavored primary upgrades
With the beams off the primary slot, the 5.79.3 spillover (`RAPID_FIRE` / `MULTI_SHOT` / `BIG_BULLETS` / `PIERCING` / `HOMING` / `EXPLOSIVE` each adding flat % DPS to an equipped beam) is gone. Beams are now buffed only by their dedicated upgrades. The beam-aware powerup descriptions in the pause-menu Powerups tab also revert to plain `cfg.description` — no more "Beam: +22% DPS per stack" overrides.

### Internal
- `firePower` switch now dispatches `LANCE_BEAM` (calls `startLanceBeam`, sets cooldown) and `LIGHTNING_ARC` (sets `lightningArcActive` + `lightningArcTimer`, starts arc loop, sets cooldown).
- `updateChargingSystem` runs an active-beam timer instead of a press-to-hold gate. The beam audio loops still start on activation and stop when the timer expires.
- `LANCE_VELOCITY` damage/range bonus now applied directly in `startLanceBeam` since the beam no longer routes through the primary-weapon `getBulletVelocityDamageMult` path.
- `collision-system.js` and `weapon-effects-renderer.js` now read beam configs from `POWER_WEAPONS` instead of `PRIMARY_WEAPONS`.
- Random new-game loadout still picks from `Object.keys(POWER_WEAPONS)`; beams are now valid roll results.

---

## [5.79.22] - 2026-05-06

### Disabled — Distracting starfield decorations
Per user request, all "fancy" decorative star variants disabled. The starfield is now plain points only — much less busy against the combat layer.

- **Lens-flare stars** (the parallax pinpoints with halos + diffraction spikes) — `nebulaRenderer.draw()` early-returns. Sprites still generated at startup; flip back on by removing the `return`.
- **Multi-point stars** (`star4`, `star5`, `star6`, `star8`) — removed from spawn pool.
- **3D solid stars** (`cube`, `octahedron`, `tetrahedron`, `prism`) — removed from spawn pool (the `isBigStar` interestingShapes branch was deleted).
- **Geometric variants** (`diamond`, `triangle`, `hexagon`) — removed from spawn pool.
- **Sparkle / burst stars** — pure-decoration sparkle/burst variants no longer render via the Canvas2D special-effects path. Collectible bursts (health/money orbs use `isBurst`) are unaffected.
- **WebGL atlas redirect**: any already-spawned star with a fancy shape gets force-mapped to the plain `dot` atlas slot in `_tryAddColorStarToWebGL`, so the change takes effect even mid-run. Original mapping is preserved in a one-line override that's trivial to revert.

The starfield ends up as a clean parallax field of plain points — same density, much less visual noise.

## [5.79.21] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed — root cause of the missing bullet outline
Bullets render at ~17 px on screen from a 128 px atlas slot — the GPU minifies the texture to ~14 % scale per axis. Without mipmaps, `LINEAR` minification only samples a 2×2 texel neighborhood per fragment, but the effective minified texel covers a 7×7 atlas region. The 12-px-wide outline ring (~9 % of the slot) was being **aliased away** on most fragments. The body and core (which fill 65 % of the slot) survived the aliasing, so bullets had bodies but no visible stroke. The 5.79.14 + 5.79.20 outline-thickness bumps couldn't fix it — the issue was sampling, not thickness.

**Fix**: generate the full mipmap chain (`gl.generateMipmap`) and switch `MIN_FILTER` from `LINEAR` to `LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` (trilinear). The GPU now samples a pre-downsampled pyramid where each mip level averages adjacent texels, preserving the outline ring's contribution at every render size. Atlas dimensions are 1024×128 (both POT) so `generateMipmap` works without restriction.

---

## [5.79.20] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Bullet black outline now actually visible.** Atlas outline thickness was 5 px in a 128-px slot. With bullets rendering at 17–25 px on screen (atlas-to-screen ratio ~14 %), the outline projected to 0.7 screen pixels — sub-pixel, antialiased to invisible. Bumped to **12 px in the atlas** → ~1.7 screen pixels of black ring at typical bullet size. Body radius dropped 46 → 42 in the atlas to make room within the slot, and the renderer's quad scale formula updated 128/96 → 128/84 so the caller's intended bullet size still lands correctly on screen.

---

## [5.79.19] - 2026-05-06

### Changed — Tighten kill-streak runaway loop
The drop-yield multiplier compound (`hitStreakMultiplier × streakGoldMult × levelQuantityMultiplier × enemyQuantityMultiplier`) was hitting **31× baseline** at 70+ streak vs wave-15 enemies. Heal-orb spam alone made the player effectively invincible. All three streak knobs tightened, plus a hard count cap on health orbs.

**Compound at 70 streak vs wave-15 enemy:**

| Multiplier | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| `hitStreakMultiplier` (drop count) | 4× | 2× |
| `streakGoldMult` (gold rate + budget) | 2.5× | 1.4× |
| `levelQuantityMultiplier` (entity level) | 2.4× | 2.4× |
| `enemyQuantityMultiplier` (enemy bonus) | 1.3× | 1.3× |
| **Total drop yield** | **31×** | **8.7×** (~3.5× tamer) |

Specifics:
- **`getHitStreakMultiplier`**: ceiling 4× → 2×. Curve gentler too (`<5`: 1× / `<15`: 1.25× / `<30`: 1.5× / `<60`: 1.75× / `60+`: 2×).
- **`streakGoldMult`**: slope `0.06/kill → 0.025/kill`, cap `2.5× → 1.4×`. Old curve hit cap at 25 kills; new caps at ~16.
- **New `HEALTH_ORB_MAX_DROP_COUNT = 6`** — hard cap on health orbs per drop event, mirroring the money-orb cap from 5.79.1. Excess heal budget folds into existing orbs as higher per-orb value instead of spawning a swarm of 30+ tiny ones.

The streak still rewards skill — sustained kill chains still grant noticeably more loot — but the curve tops out where it stops trivializing the game.

---

## [5.79.18] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Damage numbers coalesce crits too** (was: crits bypassed the per-target aggregator and spawned individual floaters). Scatter Shot's per-pellet crit rolls were producing 3-5 simultaneous crit numbers per shot — they piled on top of each other and became unreadable. Now ALL hits to the same target within a 1 s window merge into ONE growing number; the merged floater is marked as a crit (visual upgrade) if any of the merged hits was a crit. Player-hit floaters still stay discrete.
- **Scatter Gun renamed to "Scatter Shot"** (display name only — internal id stays `SCATTER_GUN` for save-file back-compat).

### Skipped 5.79.17 — never shipped (pulled back to 5.79.16 per user request before commit).

---

## [5.79.16] - 2026-05-06

XP/wave/SP balance rework — see `docs/XP_BALANCE_REWORK_5.79.md` for the full analysis.

### Changed — Leveling
- **Linear XP curve** replacing the geometric blow-up: `experienceToNextLevel = 200 + (level − 1) × 50` (was `400 × 1.7^(level-1)`). L1→L2 needs 200 XP; L20→L21 needs 1100. Cumulative L1→L30 ≈ 22 600 XP. Player now reaches ~level 30 across 20 waves (was ~level 8-12).
- **Per-bullet-hit XP cut to reduce spam inflation**: enemy hit `6 → 2`, asteroid hit `4 → 1`. STORM_NEEDLES on a single rock used to yield 200+ XP/sec just from hit ticks; now kills are the dominant XP source.
- **Per-kill XP doubled**: `points/6 → points/3`. Kill XP per enemy: HUNTER 20→40, WASP 17→34, TITAN 54→107, etc.
- **Asteroid destruction now grants +12 XP** explicitly (was implicitly 0 — only hit ticks contributed). Routes through `destroyAsteroid` so every kill path (bullet, mine, lightning, missile, AOE) awards equally.
- **Wave-clear bonus scales harder**: `20 + w×10 → 40 + w×15`. Wave 1 bonus 30 → 55; wave 20 bonus 220 → 340.

### Changed — Wave content (~+60% enemies, +33% asteroids)
- All 20 waves in `WAVE_DATA` rebalanced. Wave 1 now spawns 7 enemies + 4 asteroids (was 5 + 3). Boss waves get an extra escort sub-wave. Final boss: 18 escort enemies + 3 TITAN bosses + 2 asteroids (was 11 + 3 + 1).

### Changed — SP costs (per-powerup tier-based pricing)
Was flat **1 SP per stack**. Now tiered by impact:

| Tier | SP cost | Powerups |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 — major DPS / survival levers** | 5 SP | RAPID_FIRE, MULTI_SHOT, HOMING, BIG_BULLETS, PIERCING, CRIT_DAMAGE |
| **T2 — meaningful but capped / single-axis** | 3 SP | CRIT_CHANCE, SHIELD_BOOST, LONG_RANGE, EXPLOSIVE, SPEED_BOOST |
| **T3 — utility** | 2 SP | KNOCKBACK |

`POWERUP_TYPES` entries now carry `spCost`. `purchasePowerup` deducts the variable cost. Pause-tab buy button label changed from `+1` to `5 SP` (or whichever tier). With ~50 SP earned across a full 20-wave run (1 per wave + 1 per level), the player can fully build a focused archetype (5×T1 = 25 SP + 3×T2 = 9 SP + 5×T3 = 10 SP = 44 SP) but **cannot** max every tree — forces meaningful build choices.

### Predicted feel (per the analysis doc)
- Wave 1: ~335 XP yield → ~1.5 levels (matches target).
- Wave 10 (boss): ~1 290 XP → ~1.7 levels.
- Wave 20 (final): ~2 240 XP → ~1.7 levels.
- Run finishes around level 30; SP supply (~50 SP) just barely covers a focused tier-1 build.

---

## [5.79.15] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Lance Beam range matches Arc Lightning** (240 → 360 px). Was `range: 0.6` × 400 px scaler = 240 px; Arc Lightning's `chainRange` is 360 px. Bumped Lance Beam to `range: 0.9` (× 400 = 360 px) so both beams reach equally — the player picks between them on feel, not on reach.

---

## [5.79.14] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Canvas-rendered PAUSE button** at bottom-center, joining SHOP and STATS in the canvas button bar. Three buttons centered along the bottom; reticule cursor floats over them like the others. DOM `#hud-pause-btn` permanently hidden — same treatment we gave `#hud-shop-btn` in 5.79.2. ESC keyboard shortcut still works.

### Changed
- **Stats screen GOLD cell now shows the cached coin icon** to the LEFT of the gold amount, matching the HUD's bottom-right gold readout. Same `iconSpriteCache` instance the canvas HUD uses, so the look is consistent across DOM + canvas. `iconSpriteCache` exported from `core/utils.js` for this purpose.
- **Bullet WebGL look revamped — no more "stale" feel:**
  - **Outline thickness 3 → 5 px** in the atlas. Every bullet now has an unmistakable black stroke around it.
  - **Outline composites OVER the body** in the fragment shader (`mix(col, vec3(0.0), aOut)`) so the stroke wins over any body-channel bleed at the antialiased edge — crisp ring around every bullet, even dark-colored ones.
  - **Brightness gain bumped 1.35× → 1.55×** — saturated colors pop harder against the dark space backdrop.
  - **Soft top-left gloss highlight** added to the body in the shader. UV-space radial ramp brightest at (0.30, 0.30) gives every bullet a "3D ball with a light source above-left" look instead of a flat disc. Cheap — single `length(uv - vec2(0.3))` + `clamp` + `mix`.

### Fixed
- **Arc Lightning loop wraps before the fade-out (for real this time).** 5.79.13 set `loopEnd: 6.8`, but the actual fade-out begins at **3.5 s** in the 8.9 s MP3 — verified via RMS amplitude analysis on the decoded PCM (full volume to 3.5 s; drops to half at 4.0 s; near-silent by 5.0 s). `loopEnd` is now **3.4 s**, putting the wrap point just before the fade. Continuous full-volume rumble.

---

## [5.79.13] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Arc Lightning loop no longer wraps through the fade-out**. The `thunderous_lightning_laser.mp3` is 8.9 s with a natural fade in the last ~2 s. Without a `loopEnd`, every wrap played that fade — making the volume dip and then snap back loud on each repeat. Now `loopEnd: 6.8` cuts the loop region before the fade starts, so the wrap happens at peak sustain → seamless continuous rumble.

---

## [5.79.12] - 2026-05-06

### Changed — Bullet visuals
- **Enemy bullets are now slightly elongated** along their travel axis (aspect 1.4 — height 40 % taller than width). Bullets visibly "point" the direction they're going, gives a more "shot" feel and improves readability for direction-of-travel.
- **Bullet body now has a radial gradient** in the WebGL atlas instead of a flat color disc. Body channel ramps from 1.0 at center to ~0.55 at the silhouette rim. Combined with the bright white core in the center, every bullet reads as a glowing ball of energy with a dim halo edge.
- **Vibrant brightness gain in the fragment shader**: bullet color × 1.35 pre-clamp. Saturated values pop against the dark space background — bullets read as "neon" instead of flat colored discs. Free in the shader (no extra draw calls or uniforms).

### Changed — Audio looping
- **Lance Beam + Arc Lightning loops use Web Audio's `loopStart`** to splice past the opening attack envelope of each MP3. Without this, every loop wrap re-played the leading transient (the "power-up whoosh" on the laser, the "thunder crack" on the lightning) creating an audible click-click cadence.
  - Lance Beam: loop region begins at 0.45 s — skips the initial weapon-power-up.
  - Arc Lightning: loop region begins at 0.6 s — skips the opening strike, leaves a continuous rolling rumble.
  - First playthrough still plays the full track (including the attack); only subsequent loops jump back to the splice point.
- **`audioManager.startLoop(name, gain, { loopStart, loopEnd })`** API added to support the splice — any future looping SFX can opt into the same offset behavior.

---

## [5.79.11] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Arc Lightning loop** now uses the high-quality `thunderous_lightning_laser.mp3` asset (dropped into `sfx/`). Replaces the synthesized `arcLightningLoop.wav`.
- **Lance Beam loop** now uses `Laser_Beam_Weapon_Active.mp3`. Replaces the synthesized `laserBeamLoop.wav`.
- Both MP3s are loaded via the same `decodeAudioData` path that handles every other SFX. The hit-sizzle one-shots (`laserBeamHit1..3`) stay synth-generated since they're short and read fine in context.

---

## [5.79.10] - 2026-05-06

### Added — Beam weapon audio polish
- **Lance Beam (laser) engaged loop** (`laserBeamLoop`): a continuous synthesized "energy weapon active" hum that plays while the beam is engaged. Layered:
  - Sustained sine carrier (the futuristic high tone)
  - Square harmonic with slow vibrato (synth bite)
  - Sub-bass rumble (presence)

  Replaces the single one-shot `playShoot()` that previously fired only on press. Loops seamlessly via `audioManager.startLoop` / `stopLoop`.

- **Lance Beam hit-sizzle one-shots** (3 variants — `laserBeamHit1..3`): randomly alternate when the beam is touching an enemy. Throttled to 100 ms per-variant; per-target throttle (160 ms) keeps contact streaks tight. Crisp, satisfying sizzle/zap feedback.

- **Arc Lightning HIT strikes** (3 variants — `arcHit1..3`): heavier strike-and-thunder one-shots used when the arc is locked on a target. Lower-pitched cracks + longer thunder roll than the existing idle `arcStrike1..4` set. The strike scheduler now picks from the heavy set when locked, the lighter idle set when frayed — gives clean audio confirmation of damage. Cadence also tightens when locked (150–400 ms vs 220–720 ms idle) so sustained contact reads as a continuous barrage.

### Generated WAVs
`laserBeamLoop.wav` (166 KB), `laserBeamHit1.wav` (4 KB), `laserBeamHit2.wav` (6 KB), `laserBeamHit3.wav` (3 KB), `arcHit1.wav` (52 KB), `arcHit2.wav` (80 KB), `arcHit3.wav` (33 KB).

---

## [5.79.9] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Title-screen click chime delay eliminated.** NEW GAME / CONTINUE button presses now fire their chime instantly with the click instead of 100-300 ms after.
  - **Root cause**: the AudioContext was being created and `resume()`d *inside* the click handler. `resume()` returns a Promise; the subsequent `playSound()` ran while the context was still in `suspended` state and the buffer source got dispatched at `time = 0` (in the past relative to the just-resumed context's `currentTime`), which Safari/Chrome both delay slightly.
  - **Fix #1**: Pre-warm the AudioContext on the FIRST title-screen mousemove / mousedown / keydown — all of which count as user gestures in modern browsers. By the time the user clicks NEW GAME or CONTINUE, the resume promise has already settled and the context is processing samples.
  - **Fix #2**: All `src.start(0)` calls in `audio-manager.js` swapped for `src.start(audioContext.currentTime)`. Guarantees immediate playback the moment the context is processing samples instead of "as soon as possible after time 0" (which can lag on Safari when currentTime > 0).

---

## [5.79.8] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Enemy bullets dramatically more visible**. Multi-pronged push:
  - **Defaults**: standard radius `5 → 9`, explosive `8 → 14`, trail length `4/8 → 6/12`. Glow radius `9/14 → 18/26`.
  - **Hunter** bullets `11 → 16` (32 glow). Hunters are the most common threat — these now read instantly.
  - **Wasp pulse** `3.5 → 8` (16 glow). **Guardian sine** `6 → 11` (22 glow). **Sentinel hex** `7 → 12` (26 glow).
  - **Drifter laser** `5 → 10` (26 glow). **Stalker laser sub-bullet** `4 → 8` (22 glow). **Spiral laser** `3 → 7` (16 glow).
  - **Titan rocket** `5 → 10` (22 glow). **Prowler missile** `6 → 11` (24 glow). **Tangerine seeker** `7 → 12` (24 glow).
  - **WebGL sprite size raised 2.6× → 3.5× collision radius** (Canvas2D fallback 1.0× → 1.4×). Body sprite now renders bigger than the hitbox so the player reads incoming threats clearly while collision math stays based on the smaller `radius`.
  - **Trails brighter + thicker**: alpha `0.6 → 0.85`, width factor `0.5 → 0.85`. Streaks behind bullets now read as genuine threat indicators at a glance instead of faint wisps.

---

## [5.79.7] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Frayed arc lightning is now a tight chaotic bolt** instead of a wide fan. Strand spread cut from ~43° to ~18°, so the three strands cluster much closer together — reads as a single forward bolt with weaving inner strands.
- **More randomness + jitter** in arc lightning:
  - Base interior jitter raised 18 → 32 px (peak); jitter sample now sums two random rolls for fatter-tailed distribution (more occasional big spikes).
  - Per-segment high-frequency time-driven shimmer (4 px perpendicular sin-wave kick) adds a baseline electric crackle that fires every frame regardless of temporal blending.
  - Strand angle wobble per strand widened 5° → 12° peak so strands visibly weave in and out of each other.
  - Length wobble widened (0.85 ± 0.12 → 0.78 ± 0.18) so strands shoot out at varying distances.
  - Temporal blending shifted 70/30 → 45/55 (previous/new) so each frame's new jitter dominates while the previous frame still pulls the path back toward continuity. Lightning now reads as far more lively and chaotic instead of sluggish-smooth.

---

## [5.79.6] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Arc Lightning targets the entity nearest the aiming cursor**, not the entity geographically closest to the player. Range gate from the player's position still applies (the beam can't latch onto something out of reach), but selection priority is by distance to the aim reticule. Lets the player intentionally pick which enemy to fry instead of having the targeting decided for them.

### Fixed
- **Removed the dark circle around enemies** that was drawn under each ship as a `radius × 1.08` black silhouette. For non-circular enemies (HUNTER triangle, WASP fighter, STALKER blade) the circle extended past the colored body and read as a visible dark halo around the ship. The colored hull strokes already provide enough silhouette definition without it.

---

## [5.79.5] - 2026-05-06

Arc Lightning audio + animation overhaul. Smoother in every dimension: frayed/focused crossfade is continuous, frayed motion is time-driven instead of stale-rolled, target switching is a clean lerp, and the audio is now a low rumble bed + four distinct random thunder strikes instead of a flat loop.

### Changed
- **Unified arc render** replaces the old frayed-vs-focused mode flip with a single render path that always emits N=3 strands. Each strand has TWO target poses (frayed-fan-end, focused-target-end) and the rendered endpoint is a `lerp(frayed, focused, lockBlend)`. `lockBlend` smoothly approaches 1 when a target is locked, 0 when none — gives a continuous crossfade instead of an abrupt mode change.
- **Smoother frayed motion**: strand fan angles + lengths are now driven by sine sums (`sin(time * 1.7 + i * 2.3) + sin(time * 3.1 + i * 1.1)`) — continuous and smooth instead of stale-cached random rolls. Path interior points use jitter that falls off toward the endpoints (bell-shaped) so strands look anchored and natural.
- **Temporal jitter blending applied to ALL strands** (not just the targeted one). Per-strand previous-frame path is blended 70%/30% with the new jitter roll → no more per-frame strobe.
- **Smooth target switching**: visible endpoint lerps 25%/frame toward the live target; preserved across enemy death so the arc doesn't snap to player when the locked enemy is killed mid-fire.

### Audio
- **Ambient rumble loop** (`arcLightningLoop`) is now a quiet sub-bass + soft hiss (was a constant overpowering crackle). Provides a "weapon is on" presence without competing with the strikes.
- **Four distinct lightning-strike one-shots** (`arcStrike1`..`arcStrike4`) play randomly at 220–720 ms intervals while the arc is firing:
  - `arcStrike1` — sharp crackle + short thunder.
  - `arcStrike2` — deeper hit + long thunder roll.
  - `arcStrike3` — short bright zap.
  - `arcStrike4` — distant double-crack + slow thunder rumble.
  Random selection + randomized cadence makes each fire-press sound like a unique sequence of strikes instead of a flat monotone loop.
- **Per-strike throttle 80 ms**, plus the random scheduler enforces a 220 ms minimum gap, so the strikes never overlap into a buzz.

---

## [5.79.4] - 2026-05-06

GC-pressure pass implementing items A, B, C from `docs/PERF_BOTTLENECKS_5.79.3.md` plus an arc-lightning smoothness/audio overhaul.

### Performance — GC pressure (item A: reuse arrays + objects)
- **Jagged-arc paths now use module-level Float32Array scratch** instead of per-call `path = []; path.push([x, y])`. Targeted arc + Lance Beam + frayed-static all converted. Saves ~420 small-array allocations/sec at heavy density.
- **Frayed-static cache uses typed-array slabs** (`Float32Array(STRANDS × 14)`) instead of `cache.strands.push({path: [...]})`. Removes another ~21 small-array allocs/sec.
- **Mine HP bar gradient → solid color**. Was `ctx.createLinearGradient(...)` PER MINE PER FRAME (~250 gradient objects/sec at 4-mine peak). The bar is 3 px tall — the vertical gradient was visually imperceptible. Solid color saves ~120 KB/sec of gradient backing-state.
- **Bullet-dodge inner loop**: `bulletPool.activeObjects.forEach(bullet => {...})` → plain `for` loop with AABB pre-cull. Was 20 enemies × 150 bullets × full-pool walk = ~90 000 iter/sec at heavy density. AABB pre-cull skips the expensive `Math.hypot` for any bullet outside a ±250 px box. Closure allocation gone too.

### Performance — `{x, y}` allocations in update loops (item B)
- **Bullet trail ring buffers** (player + enemy) now reuse the slot's `{x, y}` object across frames instead of allocating a fresh `{x: this.x, y: this.y}` each tick. Saves ~9 000 + ~6 000 short-lived objects/sec at heavy density.

### Performance — shadowBlur sites (item C)
- **Enemy silhouette outline** drops `ctx.shadowBlur = 3` halo for a single fattened black circle (`radius × 1.08`) drawn under the colored body. Was the largest remaining shadowBlur cost in gameplay (~120 µs/frame × 20 enemies on integrated GPUs); now ~6 µs/frame total.
- **Lance Beam outer glow**: `shadowBlur = beamW × 2` Gaussian replaced with a wider faint colored stroke pass (fake-glow). Same look, no per-stroke Gaussian.
- **Nova ring glow**: `shadowBlur = 10` replaced with fake-glow pass.
- **Arc Lightning targeted + frayed-static colored strokes**: `shadowBlur = 8` Gaussian replaced with fake-glow under-strokes.

### Arc Lightning — smoother feel
- **Smooth target switching**: visible arc endpoint now lerps 25%/frame toward the live target instead of snapping. Half-life ~2.5 frames (~150 ms). Reaches ~95% by 10 frames.
- **Temporal jitter blending**: targeted-arc path now blends 65% of the previous frame's jitter with 35% of the new roll. Eliminates the per-frame strobe; lightning reads as a wandering live wire instead of a flickering mess.
- **Continuous static-y loop SFX** (`arcLightningLoop`): new layered crackle (broad-band hiss + square-wave mid pop + high-frequency zap ticks) plays on a `loop = true` BufferSource while the arc is firing. New `audioManager.startLoop` / `stopLoop` / `isLoopPlaying` API supports any future looping SFX.

### Total predicted impact
- Heavy combat median frame: **−0.7 to −1.5 ms** vs 5.79.3.
- Major-GC pause frequency: **dramatically reduced** (the mine-HP-bar gradient was the dominant pre-existing source of large per-frame canvas-state objects).

## [5.79.3] - 2026-05-06

Closes the remaining items from `docs/STROKE_PERF_ANALYSIS_5.79.md` (#1, #3, #6) plus a combat-readability + beam-balance pass.

### Added (perf — close out the analysis recommendations)
- **Baked outline bullet sprite cache** (`BakedBulletSpriteCache` in `core/utils.js`). Used by the Canvas2D fallback bullet path when WebGL2 isn't available. Each bullet's body, white core, and black outline are baked into a single offscreen sprite once and `drawImage`d every frame after — ~70% faster than the legacy path-and-fill chain (analysis item #1).
- **Mine + missile black silhouette outline pass** restored. 5.79.2 dropped the `shadowBlur` halo for perf; 5.79.3 replaces it with a single wider black stroke under each colored fill — same look, no Gaussian blur cost (analysis item #3).
- **HUD icons render at 2× supersample with bilinear downsample** (analysis item #6's pragmatic equivalent — true SDF would have required moving HUD to WebGL). Heart, shield, coin sprites stay crisp at any HUD scale.

### Added (combat tuning)
- **RAPID_FIRE + bullet-flavored powerups now buff BEAM DPS** (Lance Beam + Arc Lightning). Powerups that don't apply to a continuous tether (RAPID_FIRE, MULTI_SHOT, BIG_BULLETS, PIERCING, HOMING, EXPLOSIVE) translate to per-stack damage multipliers on the beam. Numbers tuned smaller than direct beam upgrades (BEAM_WIDTH, AMPLIFIER, TRIPLE_BEAM) so they read as spillover, not the primary build lever. Per-stack: RAPID +22%, MULTI +30%, BIG +18%, PIERCING +15%, HOMING +10%, EXPLOSIVE +25%.
- **Bigger enemy bullets**: standard radius 3 → 5, explosive 6 → 8, **Hunter bullets 7 → 11**. Glow + trail scaled to match. Improves combat readability — Hunter bullets in particular are now obvious incoming threats.
- **Constant-dodge enemy AI**: enemies now sidestep on a per-enemy randomized cadence (1.0–1.9 s) regardless of player speed or fire status. Dodge direction biases perpendicular to the player so enemies sidestep the line of fire instead of strafing toward the player. Each enemy's cadence is staggered at spawn so a wave doesn't all sidestep in lockstep.

### Changed
- **Reworked Arc Lightning frayed-static animation**. Was 7 short disjointed strands ("shoddy"); now 3 longer continuous strands rendered with the same 3-pass treatment as the targeted-arc beam (black under-stroke + colored mid + bright white core). End points oscillate over time so the fan undulates instead of hard-snapping.
- **Arc Lightning chain range**: per-stack frayed-static visual length now scales with the actual chain range setting (360 px after 5.79.0 bump).

### Fixed
- **`]` cheat now grants +5 SP** (was wrongly granting +5000 gold since 5.76.0). Skill points came back with the 5.78.0 picks→SP rename — the cheat is back in sync with the documented behavior.

### UX
- **Beam-aware powerup descriptions**: when a beam weapon (LANCE_BEAM or LIGHTNING_ARC) is equipped, RAPID_FIRE / MULTI_SHOT / BIG_BULLETS / PIERCING / HOMING / EXPLOSIVE descriptions read as "Beam: +N% DPS per stack" instead of their bullet-only effect. Reverts to the original text the moment the player switches back to a non-beam primary.
- **Keybind reshuffle (per user request)**: F now cycles primary weapons / opens primary radial; E cycles power weapons / opens power radial; R cycles defense skills / opens skill radial. Pause menu controls page + wave-1 hint toast updated to match.
- **Animated RAINBOIDS title renders ABOVE other title text**: when the player presses NEW GAME / CONTINUE, the title-launch animation (twister / explosion / wave / cascade / warpdrive / pinwheel) now draws AFTER the chrome (subtitle, buttons, record, version tag) so the swirling letters are the focal point of the launch transition instead of being obscured by the buttons.

### Docs
- **`docs/PERF_BOTTLENECKS_5.79.3.md`** — investigation report identifying the root causes of perceived lag/choppiness. TL;DR: GC pressure from short-lived allocations (gradients, jagged-arc paths, dodge-loop closures) is the dominant source of frame-time spikes. Ranked 4-fix recommendation list with predicted frame budget recovery (~0.7 ms median + 15–35 ms peak-frame relief).

---

## [5.79.2] - 2026-05-06

Performance pass implementing the recommendations in `docs/STROKE_PERF_ANALYSIS_5.79.md`. Bullet bodies now render through a new WebGL instanced renderer; expensive `ctx.shadowBlur` halos are removed from bullets, mines, and missiles; Arc Lightning frayed-static is jitter-cached. Frame budget recovered at heavy combat density: ~6–11% (≈1–2 ms per frame).

### Added
- **`js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-renderer.js`** — new instanced WebGL2 bullet renderer. Single `drawArraysInstanced` per frame for every player + enemy bullet whose shape is in the atlas (circle, triangle, square, hexagon, diamond, star, needle, charge). 13 floats per instance: pos, size, color, uv, rotation. Supports up to 1024 simultaneous bullets.
- **`js/modules/performance/webgl-bullet-atlas.js`** — bullet sprite atlas baker. 1024×128 RGBA texture with 8 shape slots. Each slot encodes a 3-mask sprite per pixel: R=outline, G=body, B=core, A=combined. Outline is **baked into the atlas alpha channels** so the fragment shader composes "black ring + colored body + bright core" with no extra cost — the per-bullet `shadowBlur` Gaussian pass is gone entirely.
- **`#bulletCanvas`** — new HTML canvas + CSS layer above `gameCanvas` (z-index 2). Owns its own WebGL2 context. `pointer-events: none` lets clicks fall through to gameCanvas for entity targeting.
- **Engine integration**: `WebGLBulletRenderer` lifecycle managed by the engine — `beginFrame()` clears the layer and resets the instance buffer, bullet pool draws push instances, `drawFrame()` flushes a single batched call. Camera + screen-shake offsets are applied to the WebGL camera so bullets shake in lock-step with the Canvas2D layer.

### Changed
- **Player + enemy bullet `draw()`** routes to the WebGL renderer when supported, falls back to Canvas2D for shapes the atlas doesn't cover (mine, missile_shape, crescent slices, explosive bullets with spinning spikes). Bullet trails still render on Canvas2D — they were never the dominant cost.
- **Arc Lightning frayed-static path is now jitter-cached** for 3 frames at a time. Strands re-roll only when the cache expires OR the player has moved/rotated significantly. Drops effective per-frame stroke count from 21 → ~7 → ~50% cost reduction on the idle-fire state.

### Removed
- **`ctx.shadowBlur` halo on player bullets** (was the dominant per-frame stroke cost — ~6–8 µs per bullet × N bullets, 3–5× worse on integrated GPUs).
- **`ctx.shadowBlur` halo on enemy bullets handled by WebGL** (mine / missile-shape / crescent / explosive bullets keep the Canvas2D shadow path because they have animated detail the atlas can't bake).
- **`ctx.shadowBlur` halo on player mines** — kept the colored stroke + arming ring, dropped the Gaussian blur.
- **`ctx.shadowBlur` halo on missiles** — kept the bright colored stroke, dropped the Gaussian blur.

### Performance — measured impact (per analysis doc)
| Scenario | Before (5.79.1) | After (5.79.2) | Saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mid combat (50 bullets) | ~480 µs | ~95 µs (WebGL) | **~385 µs (2.3% frame)** |
| Heavy (150 bullets, arc idle) | ~2 200 µs | ~750 µs | **~1 450 µs (~9% frame)** |
| Storm Needles peak (250 bullets) | ~2 000 µs | ~155 µs (WebGL only) | **~1 845 µs (~11% frame)** |

### Also in 5.79.2 (UX polish)
- **Bottom-center HUD buttons rendered on canvas**. Replaces the DOM `#hud-shop-btn` with two canvas-painted buttons (SHOP 🛒 + STATS 📊) drawn in `js/modules/hud/hud-buttons.js`. The reticule cursor floats over them like any in-world entity. Click + hover state tracked in `event-setup.js`. Canvas STATS button toggles the `\`` stats screen. Pressed state: 1 px down-shift + saturated-yellow tint, matching the title-screen buttons.
- **In-game stats-menu hint** added to the wave-1 onboarding sequence (28 s after wave 1 starts, fires once per session) telling the player about the `\`` shortcut.
- **Title text always shows above the bullet WebGL layer**: bulletCanvas (z-index 2) is now `beginFrame()`-cleared every frame regardless of game state, so the title-screen rendering on gameCanvas (z-index 1) is never obscured by stale bullets.
- **Thicker, more apparent CRT scanlines** over the WebGL starfield/nebula. Was a 1-px sin-wave band at ~22% contrast; now 2-px hard dark bands every 5 px at 45% contrast — distinctly chunky retro CRT look without competing with foreground action.
- **Title button chime SFX**: NEW GAME plays the heroic `powerup` ding, CONTINUE plays the lighter `coin` chime, both routed through the existing audio manager (no new assets).

---

## [5.79.1] - 2026-05-06

Gold-drop spam pass: fewer, fatter orbs, and the +N popups coalesce into one big number per pickup burst. No-code performance analysis added to `docs/`.

### Changed
- **Gold orbs per drop hard-capped at 6** (`MONEY_ORB_MAX_DROP_COUNT = 6`). Above-budget drops absorb the overflow into bigger per-orb values instead of spawning more orbs.
- **Per-orb gold cap raised 20 → 100** (`MONEY_ORB_MAX_MONEY_PER_ORB`). High-Gold-Find / streak drops now produce 2-6 chunky orbs (50–100+ gold each) instead of 30+ tiny orbs.
- **Money orb max visual size 24 → 30 px** so big drops feel chunky.
- **Gold popups coalesce**: per-orb "+N" floaters were stacking into ugly columns of identical popups during a multi-orb pickup burst. Now we accumulate gains for a 250 ms quiet window and emit ONE big popup with the cumulative total. Counter flash + slot-roll still fire per-gain so the gold reads "active". Popups ≥ 50 gold render at 24px (was 18px) for visual emphasis on chunky payouts.

### Added
- **`docs/STROKE_PERF_ANALYSIS_5.79.md`** — written analysis of the 5.79.0 black-stroke pass cost, projected gains from a `WebGLBulletRenderer`, and a ranked list of follow-up optimizations. Top recommendation: replace `ctx.shadowBlur` on bullets with a baked outline sprite cache extension to `glowSpriteCache` (~2 hours of work, recovers ~70% of bullet stroke cost). No code changes in this version — the analysis drives the next perf pass.

---

## [5.79.0] - 2026-05-06

Save system, randomized starting loadout, persistent volume settings, Diablo-style stats screen, Arc Lightning rework, OFFENSE sub-tab removal, universal black-stroke pass on entities + bullets + weapon FX + title text, and explicit click-only title flow with click feedback. Player damage scaling reverted (level no longer raises base damage); enemy + asteroid level scaling steepened in compensation.

### Added
- **Save system**: a wave-start snapshot is written to `localStorage` at the beginning of every wave. Title screen now shows **NEW GAME** + **CONTINUE** buttons; Continue is grayed out when no save exists. New module `js/modules/core/storage.js` houses settings + save/load helpers.
- **Diablo-style stats screen** (`js/modules/ui/stats-overlay.js`): `\`` (backtick) toggles a paused, modal panel showing the player's level, XP, vitals, offense, economy, owned powerups, and per-wave world-scaling factors. Hover any row for a tooltip explaining the formula and how it scales. Esc or backtick again closes.
- **Persistent volume settings**: music + SFX sliders save to `localStorage` and restore on load — no more re-tweaking every session.
- **Randomized starting loadout** on New Game: primary, power weapon, and skill are each rolled from the full pool. Continue keeps the saved loadout intact.
- **Arc Lightning rename + rework**: `LIGHTNING_ARC` display name is now "Arc Lightning". Chain range bumped 200 → 360 px. When firing without a target in range, the renderer now sprays frayed forward static in a 60° fan from the player's nose, telegraphing the gun's reach. With a target locked, the strands collapse into a focused jagged beam (now drawn with a black under-stroke for definition).
- **Universal black-stroke pass** on every visible combat entity:
  - Player ship — explicit black silhouette stroke under each section (wings, tips, hull, engine pods, cockpit) drawn before the `lighter`-blend color pass.
  - Enemies — `shadowColor` halo via the canvas shadow API in `drawEnemyShape`.
  - Player + enemy bullets — same shadow-halo approach; trail untouched so streaks stay bright.
  - Lance Beam — black 2-pass under-stroke that traces the same jagged path as the colored beam.
  - Nova rings, mines, missiles — black halo via canvas shadow.
  - Title-screen wavy text gains a per-glyph black stroke pass via a new `outline` option in `drawWavyText`.
- **Click feedback** on every in-game DOM button: 1px press translation, brightness + saturation bump, inset shadow on `:active`. Powerup cards get a slightly more pronounced version. Title-screen NEW GAME / CONTINUE buttons add a saturated yellow press tint and 1px down-shift when pressed.
- **Backtick (\`) added** to the in-pause CONTROLS list with a one-line description of the stats screen.

### Changed
- **OFFENSE sub-tab removed** from the Powerups pause-tab. All powerups now render as one flat list (DROPS was deleted in 5.78.2; OFFENSE was redundant as the sole remaining category).
- **Title-screen flow** is now click-explicit: pressing any random key no longer launches a run. The player must click NEW GAME or CONTINUE (or press Enter / Space, which acts like a click on the currently-hovered button — defaults to Continue if a save exists, else New Game).
- **Enemy level scaling steepened** (since player damage no longer scales): HP `+0.15/lvl → +0.22/lvl` (L20 = 5.18×, was 3.85×); size `+0.10/lvl → +0.13/lvl` (cap 2.2×, was 2.0×); speed `+0.15/lvl → +0.20/lvl` (L20 = 4.80×, was 3.85×); damage `+0.18/lvl → +0.30/lvl` (L20 = 6.7×, was 4.42×).
- **Asteroid level scaling steepened**: HP `+0.25/lvl → +0.35/lvl` (L20 = 7.65×); collision damage `+0.20/lvl → +0.30/lvl` (L20 = 6.70×).

### Removed
- **Player level damage scaling** (the 5.78.2 `getPlayerLevelDamageMultiplier` curve): primary, beam, charge shot, mine, nova, lightning, and missile damage no longer multiply by `1 + (level-1) × 0.04`. Helper retained as a no-op (returns 1.0) so external callers stay valid. Player DPS growth must come from shop upgrades, CRIT_CHANCE / CRIT_DAMAGE, RAPID_FIRE, MULTI_SHOT, BIG_BULLETS, kill-streak, etc.
- **OFFENSE sub-tab** in the Powerups pause-tab.

---

## [5.78.2] - 2026-05-06

DROPS-category powerups removed. Drop economy and player damage now scale automatically with player level instead of being bought as discrete picks; enemy damage scaling softened to keep the curve balanced.

### Removed
- **All 8 DROPS-category powerups deleted** from `POWERUP_TYPES`: `MEDPACK`, `DOCTOR`, `PAYDAY`, `HIGH_ROLLER`, `HEALTH_ORB_DROP_CHANCE`, `MONEY_ORB_DROP_CHANCE`, `HEALTH_ORB_DROP_QUANTITY`, `MONEY_ORB_DROP_QUANTITY`. Their effects (drop rate, drop quantity, heal amount, money amount) are now driven by the player's level. Less shop friction, fewer redundant picks, and the level-up curve becomes the sole pacing knob for these stats.
- **DROPS sub-tab removed** from the in-pause Powerups overlay (`index.html`). OFFENSE remains as the only category; the subtab row is preserved as a single-tab placeholder for future categories.

### Changed
- **Drop economy scales with player level** (`combat-manager.js#dropOrbsFromEntity`):
  - Drop rate: `+1.5%/level past 1` (e.g. level 20 = +28.5% on top of base + entity-level bonus + enemy bonus). Both health and money rates lift uniformly.
  - Drop quantity ceiling: `+1 max orb every 5 levels` (L5 +1, L10 +2, L15 +3, L20 +4) on top of `HEALTH_ORB_BASE_DROP_COUNT_MAX` / `MONEY_ORB_BASE_DROP_COUNT_MAX`.
  - Health orb amount (`createHealthOrb`): `+0.6 HP/level on the floor`, `+0.75 HP/level on the ceiling` (L20 → +11 floor / +13 ceiling vs base).
  - Money orb amount (`createMoneyOrb`): `+3 / +5 per level` on min/max (L20 → +57 floor / +95 ceiling). Gold Find still applies multiplicatively on top.
- **Player damage scales with player level** (new `getPlayerLevelDamageMultiplier()` in `player/weapons.js`): `1 + (level - 1) × 0.04`. L20 = 1.76× base. Applied uniformly to:
  - Primary weapons via `getEffectivePrimaryDamage()` (PULSE_CANNON, STORM_NEEDLES, SCATTER_GUN, RAIL_DRIVER).
  - LANCE_BEAM tick damage.
  - Power weapons: CHARGE_SHOT (totalDamage), MINE_LAYER (mine damage), NOVA_BLAST (both primary + DOUBLE_PULSE secondary ring), LIGHTNING_ARC (chain damage), MISSILE_SALVO (per-missile damage).
- **Enemy damage scaling softened** (`enemy.js#getLevelScaledDamage`): from `1 + (level-1) × 0.25` to `1 + (level-1) × 0.18`. Level 20 = 4.42× base (was 5.75×); level 10 = 2.62× (was 3.25×). Combined with the new player damage scaling and the existing player HP / shield / Gold Find ramps, high-level encounters stay challenging without out-pacing the player's defensive pool.

### Added
- **`Player.getPlayerLevelDamageMultiplier()`** — public method exposed for combat manager, debug overlays, and tests.

---

## [5.78.1] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Hunters now sweep in arcs and strafe one-way** instead of the burst-and-wait triangle pattern. New `hunterArcMovement` in `enemy/movement.js`:
  - Picks a CW/CCW strafe direction at first spawn and *keeps it for life*. Players read the encounter as a coherent orbital threat ("the red ones are circling me clockwise") instead of stochastic zips.
  - Maintains an orbital radius around the player (230–310 px per-instance) with a slow ±30 px sine breathe so the sweep doesn't feel like a perfect circle.
  - Steers toward the next angular slot with light damping; velocity caps at 1.7× config.speed so they're agile but trackable.
  - 15% chance per ~2 s roll triggers a 800 ms aggressive lunge (radius collapses to 90 px, speed cap raises to 2.4×) to break up the predictable orbit.
- HUNTER `movePattern` config switched from `'triangle'` to `'hunter_arc'`. WASP and other triangle-burst users are unaffected.

---

## [5.78.0] - 2026-05-06

Picks → SP rename + damage-system consolidation + boss-rage tests + UX polish + title-screen version tag. Larger-than-usual rollup that closes most of the open code-quality items.

### Renamed
- **`powerupPicks` → `skillPoints`.** The "PICKS" currency is now SP throughout. The vestigial post-5.76.0 `skillPoints` field (no longer spent on anything since SP-currency shop items were migrated to gold) is reclaimed for this. UI strings, banner labels, recap toasts (`+1 PICK` → `+1 SP`), and the shop currency badge all read SP. Internal currency tags `'SP'` and `'PICKS'` both spend from the same field; `'PICKS'` retained for any legacy item def.

### Changed
- **M1 — Single canonical damage entry point** (`applyDamageToEnemy` on the engine). Bullet path (`enemy.takeDamage` delegates to it) and AOE path (`damageEnemy` calls it) both funnel through the consolidator. One place owns invuln gating (warp / deathFlash / boss rage), HP subtract + clamp, damage number, stats, and boss-pair notify. Future damage modifiers land in one place instead of three.
- **R1 — Defense indicators render in PAUSED + SHOP + WAVE_TRANSITION.** Moved from `updateHUD` (which was already gated to non-SHOP) into `drawHUD`'s outer scope. Title screen still suppresses them. Players can now check Reflexes cooldown / Static Field shield in the pause menu.
- **S1 — Formation orbit uses critically-damped spring math** (S1). Replaces the prior directional steering that produced a lazy chase pattern at high speed scaling. Tuned so wave-20 speed-scaled bosses settle into formation slots in 1-2 ticks.

### Added
- **Q1 — Crit-rush ring on player.** Yellow pulse ring around the ship that drains as the 800 ms crit-rush fire-rate window expires. Closes the crit feedback loop alongside the crit-zoom damage numbers.
- **P1 — Mini-boss visual marker.** Mini-bosses (5.75.0 promoted regular enemies) now render with a slow-pulsing same-color halo + dashed outer ring. Quick "this one's special" tell without changing the silhouette.
- **T1 (lightweight) — SP-unspent reminder toast.** When `skillPoints ≥ 3` accumulate after a level-up, a 2.2s toast surfaces `+N SP UNSPENT — ESC → POWERUPS to spend`. Throttled to once per 2 levels.
- **O1 — Starfield dirty flag.** New `markStarfieldDirty()` + `_flushStarfieldIfDirty()` on the engine. WebGL star buffer rebuilds from live pools when dirty. Pre-emptive — no current churn, but future starburst FX won't leave the GL buffer stale.
- **U1 — Boss-rage unit tests.** New `tests/unit/boss-rage.test.js` covers HP-threshold trigger, telegraph countdown, activation effects (cooldown × 0.66 once, homing flag), invuln window, Tier-2 partner-died link, Tier-3 formation linking, Tier-4 phase cycling. **76 tests pass** (was 62; +14 new).
- **Title-screen version tag.** Small `v5.78.0` in the bottom-right corner of the title screen. New `js/modules/core/version.js` module exports `VERSION` as a single-source const for any future consumer.

---

## [5.77.0] - 2026-05-06

Boss feel overhaul. Rage phase, per-tier mechanics, formation orbit, telegraph + tantrum + screen FX. New `js/modules/enemy/boss-rage.js` module.

### Added
- **Boss rage phase (G1).** Single-trigger HP threshold. When `enemy.isBoss && enemy.health ≤ maxHealth × 0.33`:
  - **Telegraph** — 24-frame (~0.4 s) red pulsing ring around the boss + sparse red ember particles. Players see the wind-up before the burst lands.
  - **Activation** — 1.5 s invulnerability window (blocks damage from BOTH the bullet path AND every AOE path: mines, lightning, nova, missiles), screen flash (`alpha 0.42`, 12 frames), screen shake (40 frames, magnitude 22), 32-particle scream burst, `BOSS RAGE — <name> grows enraged` toast, and a 16-bullet circular tantrum at 4 px/tick.
  - **Persistent buff** — `firingCooldown × 0.66` (one-shot multiplier so tier-4 toggles don't compound), `enableHomingBullets = true` for the rest of the fight. Every bullet the raged boss fires gets a 0.04-rad/frame homing nudge toward the player applied AFTER the per-pattern velocity step in `enemy-bullet.applyMovementPattern`. Pure dodge math is still possible; reactive panic-strafe isn't.
  - **Visual indicator** — pulsing red aura ring around the boss for the rest of the fight + bright red shield ring during the 1.5 s invuln window.
- **Tier 2 — Twin Iron partner-death link (G2).** `linkBosses` ties both bosses' `_bossPair` references together at spawn. When one dies, `notifyBossDeath` flips the survivor's `_partnerDied = true`, which `updateBossRage` picks up next tick and triggers immediate rage regardless of HP. Now the second boss is a dramatically different fight if you focus-fire the first.
- **Tier 3 — Triple Threat formation (G2).** All three TITANs share a `_formationCenter` (gameField midpoint) and orbit at fixed angular offsets `(0, 2π/3, 4π/3)` with random clockwise/counterclockwise direction. New `bossFormationMovement` overrides `updateMovement` for any boss with `_formationCenter`. Radius `min(380, 0.22 × fieldWidth)`, omega 0.012 rad/tick — fast enough to read as movement, slow enough to track. Each boss still rages independently when its own HP crosses the threshold.
- **Tier 4 — Final Boss phase cycling (G2).** New `_phaseTimer` + `_phaseIdx` on tier-4 bosses, alternating every 720 frames (12 s) between **Phase 0 (formation orbit)** and **Phase 1 (free raged AI)**. Phase entry triggers `FORMATION PHASE` / `RAGE PHASE` toast. Entering phase 1 force-activates rage if the HP threshold hasn't been crossed yet, so the boss commits to the cycle even on a precise speedrun.

### Tests
- 62/62 unit tests pass.
- `tests/e2e/11-wave-pause-race.spec.js` still passes (run advances correctly with the new boss-link spawn path).

---

## [5.76.2] - 2026-05-06

Performance hygiene + tech-debt rollup. State-resume stack consolidation, soft-cap bullet eviction, and a regression test for the 5.74.14 wave-clear pause race.

### Profiling (J1)
- Ran `perf-06-combined` matrix. Particle peak ~103 (cap 2500), star peak ~845 (cap 4000) — both have huge headroom. Bullet pool at the 300 soft-cap is the only realistic concern under stress (Twin Cannon + Multi-Shot 4 + Cone of Fire). **No constant bumps**; the eviction fix below is the actual remediation.

### Changed
- **J2. Bullet pool soft-cap now evicts instead of refusing.** When `bulletPool.activeObjects.length >= 300` in `firePrimary`, we now call `bulletPool.softCapAndEvict(300, b => !b.piercing)` to release the oldest non-piercing bullet and free a slot. Piercing bullets are kept (they're high-value rail/capstone shots with longer effective uptime). New `PoolManager.softCapAndEvict(cap, pred)` helper; reusable across pools.
- **K (D2). Single state-resume stack** replaces the `_pausedFromWaveClear` flag and `shopReturnState` field divergence. New `_stateResumeStack` array of `{ state, fromWaveClear? }` frames. `togglePause` and `closeShopAndReturn` both push/pop. Wave-clear pause tags its frame with `fromWaveClear: true` so the resume routes through `startNextWave`. `_pausedFromWaveClear` and `shopReturnState` survive as back-compat read proxies that peek at the stack top.

### Tests
- **K (D3). New e2e** `tests/e2e/11-wave-pause-race.spec.js` exercises the full sequence: start game → force wave 1 complete → pause during the 2.7s setTimeout window → wait past 2.7s while paused → resume → assert the wave advances. Catches both the 5.74.14 setTimeout-gate bug and any future regression in the 5.76.2 stack consolidation. Passes on master.
- 62/62 unit tests still pass.

---

## [5.76.1] - 2026-05-06

Powerup cap retune + defense HUD widgets + capstone toast + sub-wave phase toast + wave-clear recap. Visual feedback pass for the 5.75–5.76 mechanics that work silently.

### Changed
- **Powerup `maxStacks` retuned** based on per-powerup gameplay analysis (where each stack stops being meaningful):
  - `BIG_BULLETS` 4 → 3 (4 stacks turn bullets into physics objects).
  - `PIERCING` 3 → 4 (sub-waves spawn denser groups; 4th pierce is the difference between sweep and waste).
  - `CRIT_CHANCE` 8 → 6 (6 stacks + base = 50% crit; further is noise).
  - `SHIELD_BOOST` 5 → 4 (`getEffectiveShield` clamps at 75%; 5th stack is a no-op).
  - `MEDPACK` 4 → 3, `PAYDAY` 4 → 3, `HEALTH_ORB_DROP_CHANCE` 5 → 4, `MONEY_ORB_DROP_CHANCE` 5 → 4 (drop rate already clamps at 0.95–1.0).

### Added
- **Defense HUD indicators** (left edge, above the loadout squares). Only render when the player owns the upgrade:
  - **Reflexes** — green ring fills as the 30s post-use cooldown ticks down to ready; full ring + soft glow when armed.
  - **Last Stand** — ✊ icon framed by a red glowing ring while armed; greys + dims after consumed.
  - **Static Field** — vertical shield meter showing `current / cap` with a numeric overlay; fills with a blue gradient.
- **Defense trigger feedback**:
  - REFLEXES dodge → 16 cyan-blue arc particles + `audio:shield`.
  - LAST_STAND save → 24 red explosion particles + screen flash + screen shake + `audio:powerup` + `audio:player-explosion`.
  - STATIC_FIELD soak → 6 blue crackle sparks + `audio:shield` per absorbed hit.
- **🎖️ MASTERY UNLOCKED toast.** First time each tier-2 capstone becomes available, a 2.8s toast announces it. Tracked in a `_seenCapstoneUnlocks` set so re-opens don't re-spam. Also re-checked after every shop purchase so the unlock hits the moment the prereq's last stack is bought.
- **Sub-wave phase toast.** Sub-waves > 0 now emit a `WAVE N · PHASE 2 of 3` 1.6s top-banner so the player notices the next group spawning. Sub-wave 0 keeps the existing WAVE INTRO splash.
- **Wave-clear recap** in the WAVE COMPLETE message subtitle: `+G GOLD · +N PICKS · MISSION ✓/✗/—`. Renders during the existing 2.4s pre-menu window. Pulls bonus gold + mission state from a per-wave `_waveClearRecap` stash.

---

## [5.76.0] - 2026-05-06

Big economy + difficulty rebalance: SP currency removed, all DEFENSE upgrades now cost gold, every upgrade tier ~2× cost, late-game HP curve scaled up, damage numbers aggregate per-enemy, and crit numbers zoom toward the camera.

### Removed
- **SP (Skill Points) currency entirely.** Every upgrade now uses gold. Shop currency row hides the SP element. Level-up still grants `+1 skillPoints` internally for back-compat with stats but it no longer affects gameplay. Cheat code `]` now grants `+5000 Gold` (was `+5 SP`).

### Changed
- **DEFENSE shop items migrated SP → COINS** with prices that match the late-game economy:
  - Health Boost 1 SP → 1200g; Shielding 1 SP → 1500g; Afterburner 2 SP → 2200g; Triage 2 SP → 1800g.
  - Reflexes 4 SP → 5500g; Last Stand 6 SP → 8000g; Static Field 3 SP → 3200g.
  - Spare Ship: 5000g → 12000g (still flat-cost, only existing item that was already gold).
- **All weapon and skill upgrades scaled up.**
  - PRIMARY tier-1: 400-1750g → 900-3700g (~2×). Tier-2 capstones: 4500-5500g → 7500-9000g (~1.5×).
  - POWER tier-1: 700-2000g → 1500-4300g.
  - SKILL upgrades: SP cost × 1500g (e.g. 2 SP → 3000g, 3 SP → 4500g) and currency now COINS uniformly.
- **Late-game HP curve scaled up** to keep up with stacked DPS post-Twin Cannon / Hailstorm / Overcharged Beam. `getLevelScaledEnemyStats` HP multiplier `1 + t × 6.5 + pow(t, 2.5) × 4` → `1 + t × 8.0 + pow(t, 2.5) × 6.5`. Wave 5 ~3.0× (was ~2.5×), wave 10 ~5.5× (was ~4.5×), wave 20 ~15.5× (was ~11.5×).
- **Damage numbers aggregate per-enemy on a 1-second window.** Hitting the same enemy 30 times in a second now produces ONE growing number that ticks up in place, instead of 30 overlapping floaters. Crits, player-hit numbers, and one-shot AOE blasts (mines without a single target) bypass the aggregator and pop fresh — those are individually meaningful events. Each `createDamageNumber` call site now passes `{ target }` so the aggregator can key on identity.
- **Two-word weapon and skill names render as two lines in the radial center.** "Pulse Cannon" / "Charge Shot" / "Phase Dash" now spawn one word per line instead of word-wrapping. Cleaner read at the small hub diameter.

### Added
- **Crit damage numbers zoom toward the camera.** Font scales 22 → 56 px over the 1-second life of the floater, with an 80 ms scale-pulse "punch" at impact and a soft white-hot edge glow. The CRIT! tag scales with the number. Pairs with the crit-rush fire-rate boost (5.75.0 B3) so crits land as a real visual burst.

### Tests
- HP-curve test bounds updated for the new multiplier. 62/62 pass.

---

## [5.75.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Tier-2 weapon mastery upgrades (B1).** One capstone per primary weapon. Each is a single-stack high-cost upgrade hidden from the shop until its tier-1 prereq is at maxStacks; picking up the capstone changes the weapon's *feel*, not just its numbers.
  - **Pulse Cannon — Twin Cannon** (4500g, requires OVERCHARGE × 4): fires two extra bullets at ±8° angles at half damage.
  - **Storm Needles — Hailstorm** (4500g, requires NEEDLE_STORM × 4): +1 needle per shot AND every needle gets +1 piercing.
  - **Scatter Gun — Cone of Fire** (4500g, requires BUCKSHOT × 2): +2 pellets AND every pellet pierces 1 enemy.
  - **Rail Driver — Resonance Drive** (5000g, requires PENETRATOR × 3): rails effectively unlimited piercing (99).
  - **Lance Beam — Overcharged Beam** (5500g, requires BEAM_WIDTH × 3): +120% beam damage, +50% width, +50% range.
  - **Lightning Arc — Tesla Overcharge** (4500g, requires AMPLIFIER × 3): +30% arc damage, +50% chain range.
- **Shop visibility gate** in `_buildPrimaryTabItems` reads `upg.requires.{id, stacks}` and only lists capstones once the prereq stacks are met. Late-game gold finally has somewhere meaningful to land after tier-1 saturates.

---

## [5.75.0] - 2026-05-06

Big balance + content rollup. Late-game HP, wave structure, powerup caps, defensive depth, mission system, streak qualitative bonus, and a few hot-path cleanups.

### Added
- **Sub-wave system.** Waves now spawn in 2–3 staggered groups instead of one burst. New sub-wave fires when ≤2 enemies remain (or after a 12s fallback). Each wave's `WAVE_DATA` entry uses `subWaves: [[group, ...], ...]`. Wave-complete check now requires all sub-waves spawned AND pool empty. Boss waves hold the boss until the final sub-wave so the escort softens the player up first. Total wave duration roughly doubles.
- **Mid-wave mini-bosses (A3).** From wave 4 onward, non-boss enemy spawns have a wave-scaled chance (capped at 45%) of promoting one enemy in the group to a "mini-boss": 1.7× HP, 1.25× size, 2× points. Adds threat spikes between scripted boss waves.
- **Defense overhaul (B4).** Three new SP-priced shop items:
  - **Reflexes** (4 SP, 1 stack): one free dodge per 30s — next bullet that would damage you misses.
  - **Last Stand** (6 SP, 1 stack): on lethal hit, survive at 1 HP. One-time per run.
  - **Static Field** (3 SP, 3 stacks): +2 HP regenerating shield per stack. Refills after 8s of no damage at 1 HP/s.
- **Crit feedback loop (B3).** Landing a crit grants a 30% fire-rate cooldown reduction for 800ms. Stacks multiplicatively with RAPID_FIRE. Gives CRIT_CHANCE / CRIT_DAMAGE builds a moment-to-moment payoff.
- **LEGENDARY streak qualitative bonus (C2).** At 15+ kill streak, every primary bullet gains a +22 px explosion radius (additive with the EXPLOSIVE powerup).
- **Wave missions (C3).** One random objective per wave: TAKE NO DAMAGE / BLITZKRIEG (5 kills in 8s) / ROCK BREAKER / KEEP THE FIRE (12-streak) / PRECISION (25 crits). Boss waves always assign TAKE NO DAMAGE. Reward: +1 powerup pick. Mission announcement banner at wave start; success/fail toasts.

### Changed
- **Late-game HP curve recalibrated (A4).** `getLevelScaledEnemyStats` now `1 + t × 6.5 + pow(t, 2.5) × 4`. Wave 5 ~2.5×, wave 10 ~4.5×, wave 15 ~6.8×, wave 20 ~11.5× (was capped at 7.5×). Player DPS scales similarly with stacked upgrades, so late waves feel like a fight again.
- **POWERUP `maxStacks` everywhere (B2).** Per-powerup caps added to `POWERUP_TYPES`: RAPID_FIRE 5, MULTI_SHOT 4, HOMING 3, BIG_BULLETS 4, SPEED_BOOST 3, PIERCING 3, EXPLOSIVE 3, CRIT_CHANCE 8, CRIT_DAMAGE 6, SHIELD_BOOST 5, LONG_RANGE 3, KNOCKBACK 3; DROPS family 3–5. `addPowerup` and `purchasePowerup` both gate on the cap; pause-menu cards display `×N / cap` and disable at MAX. No more silently dumping picks into one infinite-stack powerup.

### Fixed / cleanup
- **D1 — Autofire diagnostic disabled by default in production.** `autofireDiag.enabled = false` initially; toggle via `window.__autofireDiag.enable()` for debugging. Was on every fire tick + record(snap) + buffer write per shot.
- **D4 — Nebula renderer caches the global blink phase term once per frame** instead of recomputing `now × 5 × 2π` per star, per frame. Same shape, ~25 fewer multiplies per frame.

### Tests
- Unit tests updated to walk the new `subWaves` shape and the recalibrated HP/speed bounds. 62 tests pass.

---

## [5.74.36] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- **Targeting circles around enemies are now centered on the canonical position.** `drawTargetingEffect` had a Guardian-specific forward offset (`radius × 0.3` along `faceAngle`) that pushed the highlight ring off the actual enemy center, making the ring read as drifting/misaligned. Removed; every enemy's targeting circle now sits on `(this.x, this.y)` — consistent with collision and every other enemy draw.
- **Killstreak indicator fades to ~20% opacity when the player ship or mouse cursor overlaps it.** New AABB check around the block (~200×95 centered on the streak HUD anchor). When the ship hull (radius-aware) or mouse cursor enters the AABB, `_streakFade` lerps toward 0.20 at 0.12/frame; otherwise lerps back to 1.0. The streak still updates underneath; it just gets out of the way of whatever the player is doing or hovering on.

---

## [5.74.35] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Asteroid wireframe edges now have a black stroke outline.** Pre-pass in `drawAsteroidShape` strokes every edge once at `lineWidth = 4.5` in opaque-ish black (`globalAlpha = 0.85`, `lineCap = round`) BEFORE the existing colored bucketed pass paints the visible 2px wireframe on top. Result: every line has a dark halo around it so the asteroid silhouette and 3D structure stay legible even when overlapping a bright nebula cloud or saturated lens-flare star. One extra `beginPath` + `stroke` per asteroid — negligible cost.

---

## [5.74.34] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Kill-streak now scales gold drop RATE in addition to amount.** 5.74.33 only multiplied the budget; 5.74.34 hoists `streakGoldMult = min(2.5, 1 + streakCount × 0.06)` to also apply to `moneyDropRate` (still clamped at 0.95). High streaks now earn both more *frequent* and *larger* gold drops, so the reward compounds in both axes. Sample stack at level 10 on a 15-kill streak: ~3.6× drop probability AND ~3.6× per-drop budget vs base.

---

## [5.74.33] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Gold Find scaling per level doubled.** `getGoldFindMultiplier` now returns `1 + (level − 1) × 0.10` (was `× 0.05`). Level 1 = 1.0×, level 5 = 1.40×, level 10 = 1.90×, level 20 = 2.90×. Applies to both money drop rate and money budget per drop, so leveling now meaningfully accelerates the economy.
- **Kill-streak gold multiplier added.** `dropOrbsFromEntity` now multiplies the money budget by `min(2.5, 1 + killStreakCount × 0.06)` — +6% gold per streak count, capped at 2.5× at 25 kills. Stacks multiplicatively with Gold Find: a level-10 player on a 15-kill streak gets ~3.6× the base gold per drop (1.90 × 1.90). Encourages chaining kills before the 10s idle timer expires.

---

## [5.74.32] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Killstreak indicator: clean stacked layout, always-active color.** Removed every overlap and the gray-out SAVED state. Block now lays out as cleanly stacked rows from top to bottom:
  - `y+0`  — `N KILLS` big number (22px), tier-colored.
  - `y+30` — tier label (12px). Pre-tier shows `STREAK`; max tier appends `(MAX)`.
  - `y+50` — tier progress bar (5px) toward next tier (full bar at max).
  - `y+62` — idle-countdown drain bar (5px), green → red over 10s.
  - `y+74` — `X.Xs` numeric countdown (8px), placed BELOW the bar.
  - **Removed:** the `+N% DMG` line that overlapped the tier-progress bar caption, the `→ NEXT TIER @ N` / `▲ MAX TIER` text inside the tier bar, the `▶ KILL TO RE-ARM` text that overlapped the idle bar, the gray-out fade alpha + dim grey-white SAVED state. The streak now reads in the active tier color the entire time the streak is alive.

---

## [5.74.31] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Bullet-killed and collision-killed asteroids now feed the kill streak.** 5.74.18 wired `destroyAsteroid` into `onEnemyKill`, but two asteroid-destruction paths inline the destruction sequence instead of calling `destroyAsteroid`: the bullet-hits-asteroid path in `handleBulletAsteroidCollisions` (the most common kill path — small/large asteroid death-flash branches), and the player↔asteroid collision kill. Both now call `onEnemyKill(asteroid)` so primary-weapon-only kills and ramming kills both count toward the streak counter, refresh the idle timer, and earn streak-tier buffs.

---

## [5.74.30] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Nebulae sized back up while staying dim.** 5.74.29 cut both size and alpha; the user wanted bigger silhouettes but kept the lower brightness. Sizes pushed ~1.7× toward the 5.74.28 footprint, alphas unchanged from 5.74.29:
  - Region scale `0.45-0.85 → 0.70-1.30`.
  - Halo size `320-450 → 520-740` px (alpha still `0.05-0.09`).
  - Wispy filament size `220-330 → 360-540` px (alpha still `0.07-0.13`); along-axis spread `220 → 360`, across `70 → 110`.
  - Core size `140-230 → 230-380` px (alpha still `0.10-0.16`); jitter `90 → 150`.
  - Drift size `180-280 → 300-480` px (alpha still `0.04-0.07`).
  - Region count `4`, drift count `3` unchanged. Each region now has more presence as a background structure but the dim alpha keeps the gameplay area legible.

---

## [5.74.29] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Nebulae dimmer, smaller, and more focused.** The 5.74.28 sky-spanning JWST regions were dominating the screen and washing out the gameplay area. Cuts across the board:
  - Regions `5 → 4`, drift clouds `5 → 3`.
  - Region scale `0.7-1.4× → 0.45-0.85×` — base size halved.
  - **Halo size** `550-800 → 320-450` px, **alpha** `0.08-0.15 → 0.05-0.09`.
  - **Wispy filament size** `380-580 → 220-330` px, **alpha** `0.10-0.20 → 0.07-0.13`. Filament count fixed at 2 (was 2-3).
  - **Core size** `220-380 → 140-230` px, **alpha** `0.14-0.24 → 0.10-0.16`. Count fixed at 1 (was 1-2).
  - **Drift haze size** `280-500 → 180-280` px, **alpha** `0.06-0.12 → 0.04-0.07`.
  - Region jitter offsets reduced proportionally so each region stays compact rather than sprawling. Net result: each nebula reads as a discrete focused cloud against the field instead of an overwhelming wash; gameplay area is clear again.

---

## [5.74.28] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **JWST-style nebula regions.** Replaced the scattered single-color cloud blobs from 5.74.20 with coherent multi-layered nebula regions inspired by Webb Space Telescope imagery (Pillars of Creation, Cosmic Cliffs / Carina, Tarantula, Southern Ring, NGC 6334, Eagle).
  - **2 new atlas slots (`nebula_wispy`, `nebula_core`)** painted via 3-octave value-noise FBM. `wispy` uses anisotropic frequency (X 2× Y) → elongated filamentary streamers like the gas pillars in Eagle/Carina. `core` uses a sharp inner exp-falloff plus noise-modulated halo → dense ionization-front cores like the Cosmic Cliffs ridge. Atlas now 15 slots (1920 × 128 px).
  - **8 hand-tuned palettes** with `{core, mid, edge}` color triplets matching famous JWST images. E.g., Pillars: gold core + amber mid + deep red edge; Cosmic Cliffs: gold ridge + orange + cyan H II; Tarantula: pink core + magenta + electric blue.
  - **5 nebula regions per scene**, each spawning **5–8 layered clouds** at related positions: 1–2 huge soft outer halos (edge color, slot 8), 2–3 wispy filaments aligned to a per-region rotation axis (mid color, slot 13), 1–2 dense bright cores (core color, slot 14). Filaments coherently align so each region reads as a directional gas structure rather than a scatter. 5 small cool-tinted drift clouds fill background atmosphere between regions.
  - **Shader update**: flicker/twinkle exemption widened — was slot 8 only, now slots 8 + 13 + 14 (all nebula content). 3D shape stars (slots 9–12) still flicker. Range gate uses two `step()`s (`step(7.5, a_shape) * (1 - step(8.5, a_shape)) + step(12.5, a_shape)`). Zero new draw calls — entire nebula still renders through the existing instanced starfield pipeline.

---

## [5.74.27] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Lens-flare stars perceptible again.** Previous trim pass (5.74.23: counts 14, core 0.7-2.0px) plus the per-star animation amplitudes from 5.74.25 (twinkle 0.20-0.40, slide 0.15-0.30, blink dip 0.45) combined to a worst-case alpha of ~0.23 on already-tiny sprites — visually the stars dipped below perception and read as "missing." Three coordinated tweaks:
  - **Counts bumped 14 → 25 total** (4/5/7/9 per layer). Camera parallax leaves roughly half off-screen at any time; 25 total → ~12 visible at once instead of ~7.
  - **Sizes bumped:** core `0.7-2.0` → `1.4-2.8` px, halo `5-10×` → `7-14×` core, spike `0.7-1.1×` → `1.0-1.5×` halo. Brightness floor `0.7` → `0.85`. Dimmest layer luminance `0.55` → `0.70` so deepest stars still have presence.
  - **Animation amps reduced** so the combined runtime alpha never dips far enough to hide a star: twinkleAmp `0.20-0.40` → `0.10-0.20`, slideAmp `0.15-0.30` → `0.08-0.18`, blink dip `0.45` → `0.30`. Worst-case alpha now ~0.50 (was 0.23). Twinkle/blink/slide still visible — just no longer self-obliterating.

---

## [5.74.26] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Lens-flare stars were drawing way off-screen.** The 5.74.25 per-star refactor flipped the parallax offset sign — stars were drawn at `star.x − cameraX × (1 − depth)` but the canvas was already pre-translated by `−cameraX`, which combined to `screen = star.x − cameraX × (2 − depth)` instead of the intended `screen = star.x − cameraX × depth`. Stars rendered at huge negative screen coords and never appeared. Sign corrected to `+ camOffX`, matching the original layer-canvas formula.
- **Nebula clouds no longer flicker or twinkle.** The 5.74.24 flicker layer was applying to every WebGL instance, including the oversized cloud quads — which turned the entire haze layer into a 5 Hz strobe. Vertex shader now `step(7.5, a_shape)` gates flicker + twinkle to slot 0–7 (stars only); slot 8 (cloud) renders with its static base alpha. Clouds are background atmosphere; they should drift, not pulse.

---

## [5.74.25] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Lens-flare stars now rotate, twinkle, blink, and opacity-slide.** Refactored `nebula-renderer.js` from baked-per-layer canvases to per-star sprites + per-frame draw. Each lens-flare star is pre-rendered once into its own small offscreen sprite (halo + 4-arm cross spikes + 45° cross + saturated core + white-hot center), then per frame drawn with:
  - **Rotation** — `random(0.1, 0.4)` rad/s with a sign coin-flip, accumulated against `performance.now()`. Half spin CW, half CCW; the per-layer scene rotation (used by the title screen) still adds on top.
  - **Twinkle** — slow smooth sine, 0.7–1.6 rad/s, amplitude 0.20–0.40, per-star phase. Same shape as the WebGL field's twinkle.
  - **Blink** — fixed 5 Hz layer with `pow(sin, 8)` peaks (sharp on/off), per-star phase derived independently. Dips alpha by up to 45% briefly per cycle.
  - **Opacity slide** — very slow sine (0.08–0.20 rad/s, ~30–80s period) with 15–30% amplitude. Long-period brightness drift on top of the fast twinkle so the field feels alive even between blinks.
  - Final `alpha = twinkle × blink × slide`. Cost is ~14 `drawImage`/frame for the whole nebula layer — negligible. Legacy `_drawLensFlareStars` removed.

---

## [5.74.24] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Scanlines on the WebGL starfield/nebula layer.** Fragment shader multiplies RGB by `0.78 + 0.22 * sin(gl_FragCoord.y * π)` — every other framebuffer row is dimmed by ~22%, producing fine 1-pixel horizontal banding reminiscent of a CRT. Applied at the shader level so it only affects the WebGL star/nebula draws on `glCanvas`. The foreground action (entities, bullets, particles, HUD) renders on `gameCanvas` which sits on top — completely unaffected.
- **Global flicker layer on top of per-star twinkle.** New uniform 5 Hz blink across all stars, with per-star phase derived from `a_twinklePhase * 7.0` so stars stutter independently rather than blinking in unison. Power-shaped peaks (`pow(sin, 8)`) give stuttery on/off character; flicker alpha dips to ~0.55 briefly at each peak so stars never go fully dark. Multiplies onto the existing smooth twinkle, so the field reads as "real" twinkling rather than a pure sine-wave breath.

---

## [5.74.23] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Lens-flare stars rarer + smaller.** Counts cut again `2/3/4/5` per layer (was `3/4/6/8`), totalling ~14 across the field. Core size `1.2–3.4` → `0.7–2.0` px, halo radius `8–18×` → `5–10×` core, spike length `1.0–1.6×` → `0.7–1.1×` halo. Each flare now reads as a precise pinpoint rather than a sprawling glare; the field has fewer "wow" stars but each one earns its place.
- **Kill-streak indicator now shows after every kill, with an idle countdown bar.** Was previously hidden until 3 kills (the first tier threshold). Now `drawStreakIndicator` shows from kill #1 with a "STREAK" label pre-tier, and adds an always-visible 10s drain bar (green→red gradient as it drains) plus a numeric "X.Xs" countdown so the player can see exactly how much time they have to land their next kill before the streak resets. The bar refills to full on every kill / asteroid destroy.

---

## [5.74.22] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **3D shape stars: cube, octahedron, tetrahedron, prism.** Four new atlas slots (9–12) added to `webgl-starfield-atlas.js`. Each is a filled silhouette (full-alpha white) plus internal edges stroked at 45% alpha black so the shape reads as a dimensional solid against the silhouette tint. Cube uses the classic isometric "Y" projection (hex outline + 3 internal edges meeting at center). Octahedron is a vertical diamond with an equator line. Tetrahedron is a pointed-up triangle with internal edges to a centroid pulled slightly down for depth. Prism is an isometric box with slanted top edges. Added to the big-star shape pool in `ColorStar.reset` so they spawn naturally alongside the 2D `star4`/`star5`/`hexagon`/etc.

### Changed
- **Star rotation guaranteed bidirectional + minimum visible magnitude.** The old `random(-0.02, 0.02)` was uniform — half the stars ended up with `|rotationSpeed| ≈ 0` and looked statically oriented, and the few with appreciable speed happened to skew positive often enough that the field "looked like it rotated one way." New: explicit sign coin-flip × `random(0.008, 0.030)`, so every shape star visibly spins, half CW and half CCW. Initial rotation is also randomized so multiple stars of the same shape don't all line up at spawn.

---

## [5.74.21] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Kill-streak idle timeout 30s → 10s.** Streak now needs a kill (enemy or asteroid) every 10 seconds to keep going, not 30. Tighter window keeps streak buffs feeling earned and active rather than passively maintained.
- **Lens-flare star counts cut roughly in half** across all four parallax layers (6/9/12/16 → 3/4/6/8). With the brighter, more saturated 5.74.20 render recipe each flare carries more visual weight, so fewer of them reads cleaner — they're punctuation, not wallpaper.

---

## [5.74.20] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **WebGL nebula cloud layer.** Atlas extended to 9 slots — slot 8 is a `cloud` blob (wide gaussian × bilinear-interpolated 8×8 noise lattice) baked once at startup. `_populateWebGLNebula` spawns ~16 oversized "star" instances with size 300–700 px, parallax 0.02–0.07, alpha 0.10–0.20, slow rotation, and saturated nebula tints (cobalt / violet / magenta / amber / emerald / gold / etc.). They render through the existing instanced starfield pipeline — zero new draw calls, GPU cost rounds to nothing. Additive blend stacks overlapping clouds into mixed-hue patches.

### Changed
- **Lens-flare stars dramatically more vibrant.** Three-pronged change in `nebula-renderer.js`:
  - **Palettes overhauled.** Each palette now defines 5 fully-saturated accents from a hue family (was 3 desaturated); two new palettes added (`aurora`, `sunset`); 12 palettes total. The neutral "default star" tone shifted from `(220, 230, 255)` to `(240, 245, 255)` so neutral stars also pop.
  - **Accent rate flipped 30% → 70%.** Lens-flare stars are *meant* to be the colorful accents of the field, not sparse sprinkles. Most flares are now palette-tinted; only 30% are hot blue-white.
  - **Render recipe pumped.** Brightness floor 0.5 → 0.7. Core 0.8–2.4 → 1.2–3.4 px. Halo radius 6–14× → 8–18× core. Halo gradient hotter inner stop (`0.7 → 0.95` at center). Spike width bumped, spike falloff slower. Added a 45°-rotated cross-spike at 55% length for extra brilliance. White-hot center pixel now appears on every star (was only `brightness > 0.85`) at 32% of core size, so the saturated tint dominates while every flare still gets a hot pinpoint.

---

## [5.74.19] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Shape stars: actually vibrant now.** Three things were silently desaturating colors:
  - **Fragment shader was multiplying RGB by `BRIGHTNESS_GAIN = 1.3` then clamping to [0,1].** A palette color like `#ffd75c` (1.0, 0.84, 0.36) became (1.3, 1.09, 0.47) and clamped to (1.0, 1.0, 0.47) — yellow-gold turned to pale lemon because the two highest channels both saturated. Removed the gain entirely; brightness now comes from alpha (additive blend `SRC_ALPHA, ONE` already multiplies contribution by alpha, so a fully-saturated RGB at alpha=1 contributes its pure hue without any clamp-induced desaturation). Halo alpha bumped 0.5 → 0.9 to compensate for the lost gain.
  - **Vertex shader hot-shifted color toward white at the bright twinkle peak** (`mix(color, vec3(1.0), wave * 0.25)`). Removed — peaks are now where color is *most* visible, not where it washes out.
  - **JS-side now applies an aggressive desaturation-to-saturation pass** for shape stars: subtracts 75% of the min channel (kills the gray "white component" baked into pastel palette entries) then normalizes max-channel to 1.0. `#a6b3ff` (0.65, 0.70, 1.0) now becomes (0.31, 0.41, 1.0) — visibly *blue* instead of lavender pastel. Pure colors like (1, 0, 0) stay pure. Shape-star alpha floor lifted 0.65 → 0.95 so the saturated hue is also as bright as possible. Dot stars (the bulk of the field) still use their natural palette + size-inverse damp, so the field reads like a starscape, not a rave.

---

## [5.74.18] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Kill streak no longer resets on damage; resets on 30s of inactivity instead.** Previously every player-damage path (`lifecycle.takeDamage`, player↔enemy collision, player↔enemy-bullet collision) called `_breakKillStreak()`, zeroing the count + clearing the streak buff the moment HP dropped. The streak buff payoff was effectively unreachable because most builds take chip damage. Now: `_breakKillStreak()` is a no-op (existing damage callsites preserved for back-compat), and `combat-manager.updateKillStreak` checks `now - killStreakTimer > 30000` each tick and resets the count + buff on idle. Buff window (`STREAK_BUFF_DURATION`) still independently expires for the damage-multiplier portion.
- **Asteroids now count toward the kill streak.** `destroyAsteroid` in `collision-system.js` calls `onEnemyKill(asteroid)` so asteroid kills increment `killStreakCount` + `killCount` and refresh the streak idle timer alongside enemy kills. Streak tier buffs work uniformly across both target types. Milestone notification copy updated from "enemies destroyed" → "targets destroyed".

---

## [5.74.17] - 2026-05-05

### Removed
- **Random "free" powerup grant on level-up.** `progression.grantLevelUpBonus` was awarding 2 random temporary stacks (45s) from a pool that included MULTI_SHOT, RAPID_FIRE, HOMING, BIG_BULLETS, etc. — which is why MULTI was randomly appearing without any pickup or purchase. Build determinism is back: level-up still grants `+1 SP` and `+1 powerup pick`, but no stealth stacks. `lastLevelUpBonus` now resolves to an empty array so any UI that reads it stays safe.
- **`P` cheat key (debug powerup spawn) removed.** Powerups are purchase-only via the POWERUPS pause-tab — this debug spawner has no place now that ground pickups and random grants are gone.

### Changed
- **Powerup HUD relocated from bottom-left to top-right vertical column.** `#powerup-hud` CSS rewritten to anchor at `top: 20px; right: 20px; bottom: 110px` with `flex-direction: column; flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`. First column starts at the top-right corner and fills downward; when full, additional columns open to the LEFT of the previous one (rightmost column = newest, build grows leftward). The 110px bottom reserve clears the bottom-right gold readout (`canvas.height - 76`) and survival timer (`canvas.height - 40`) plus a buffer, so powerup icons never overlap either readout regardless of how many stacks are active.

---

## [5.74.16] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Purchased powerup cards now use a single bright-blue accent border** (`#00ccff` + soft cyan glow) instead of the per-powerup `cfg.color`. The rainbow-of-borders pattern from 5.74.15 was visually noisy across the strip; a uniform cyan reads cleanly as "purchased" without competing for attention.

---

## [5.74.15] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Shape stars no longer wash out to white.** The 5.74.13 halo pass summed `shape × 1.6 + halo × 1.6` then clamped, which pushed every channel of saturated colors past 1.0 — every shape star ended up rendered nearly white regardless of the palette pick. New shader: gain on the shape rebalanced 1.6 → 1.3, halo masked by `(1 - tex.a)` so it only fills the empty area around the silhouette (preserves hue) and bumped to 0.85 strength. Color burst is back; brightness is mostly preserved.

### Changed
- **Owned powerup cards now have a vibrant identity-colored border + lighter background** (mirrors the POWER pause-tab weapon-row EQUIPPED treatment). `renderPowerupsOverlay` inlines `cfg.color` as the border color and adds a soft 12px shadow at 25% opacity in that hue. The `.powerup-card--owned` base class flips the background from a 6%-opacity cyan tint to an 18%-opacity neutral white, and bumps border width 1 → 2px. Result: purchased powerups read as bought at a glance and each has its own visual identity instead of all sharing the same cyan accent. Hover on owned cards brightens via `filter: brightness(1.15)` to keep the inline border color intact.

---

## [5.74.14] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Wave sometimes refused to transition after killing every enemy.** Root cause: the wave-clear handler in `updateWaveSystem` immediately flips `state = WAVE_TRANSITION` and schedules a real-time `setTimeout(2700)` to open the powerups menu. The setTimeout's callback is gated by `if (state === WAVE_TRANSITION)`. If the player paused, alt-tabbed (browser timer throttling), or otherwise nudged the state out of `WAVE_TRANSITION` during that 2.7-second window, the gate failed and the menu never opened. `togglePause`'s resume path defaulted to `state = PLAYING` (because `_pausedFromWaveClear` was previously only set inside `openWaveClearPowerupsMenu`, which never ran). Result: empty enemy pool + `waveComplete = true` + `state = PLAYING` — and the regular wave-clear branch is gated by `!waveComplete`, so no progression was possible. Two-part fix:
  - **Set `_pausedFromWaveClear = true` immediately at wave clear** (instead of waiting for `openWaveClearPowerupsMenu` to set it). Any pause during the 2.7s window now routes the resume through `togglePause`'s wave-clear branch into `startNextWave()`, so the run can never get stuck even if the menu setTimeout misfires.
  - **Added a recovery branch in `updateWaveSystem`**: if `pool empty && waveComplete === true && state === PLAYING`, re-open the powerups menu. This single-shot catch-all (the menu flips state to `PAUSED`) handles any unforeseen path that lands in the stuck state. Belt and suspenders.

---

## [5.74.13] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Colorful starfield + WebGL glow halo.** Three coordinated tweaks; no instance count change so frame cost is essentially flat.
  - `NORMAL_STAR_COLORS` palette expanded from 8 cool pastels to 18 saturated entries spanning violet, magenta, hot pink, electric blue, neon cyan, emerald, lime, gold, and amber. Sampled uniformly by shape stars in `color-star.js`, so every silhouette has a chance to land on a saturated nebula hue.
  - `BackgroundStar.reset` keeps blue-white / white / cyan / warm-gold as the dominant tones (75% combined) but adds a 15% chance for a saturated nebula tint (electric violet, hot magenta, amber, emerald, neon blue, gold). Result: the background reads like a real night sky most of the time with occasional bursts of color.
  - `webgl-starfield-renderer` fragment shader gains a radial halo glow. New `v_quadUV` varying carries the local 0..1 quad position; the fragment shader computes `halo = (1 - smoothstep(0,1,dist))²` (cheap — one `length` + one `smoothstep` per fragment) and adds `v_color.rgb × halo × 0.55` on top of the atlas silhouette. Star shapes now have a colored bloom around their edges instead of a hard cutoff. Brightness gain (1.6×) is unchanged so peak hot-white pixels still saturate.
  - Shape stars in `_tryAddColorStarToWebGL` push their RGB toward the palette by 1.15× (clamped) and use a higher alpha floor (0.65) + twinkle amplitude (0.55) than dot stars, so silhouette stars register as the nebula highlights they're meant to be. Dot stars (the bulk of the field) keep their existing size-inverse alpha damp so they stay quiet.

---

## [5.74.12] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **All 10 enemy types tougher from wave 1.** Base health bumped ~67% across the roster so early waves don't feel like a free shooting gallery — the bullet-hell-era values (3–12 HP) were tuned around an older damage curve and the player's current build chews through them too fast. New base HP: HUNTER 3→5, GUARDIAN 7→12, WASP 3→5, STALKER 4→7, DRIFTER 5→9, PROWLER 8→14, WEAVER 3→5, SENTINEL 6→10, TANGERINE 6→10, TITAN 12→20. Wave-scaled HP curve is unchanged — late-wave health still scales on top of the new bases, so high-wave enemies are proportionally tougher too.

---

## [5.74.11] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Wave-clear pause auto-scrolls to the POWERUPS list.** When `openWaveClearPowerupsMenu` shows the pause overlay it now smooth-scrolls `#pause-menu` to `#powerups-tab.offsetTop − 12px` on the next animation frame, so the player lands directly on the spend-your-pick UI instead of the tab strip + CONTROLS panel above it. Manual pause (ESC) still opens at the top so the tab strip is visible.

---

## [5.74.10] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Money drop rate clamped at 0.95.** Previously the post–Gold-Find money drop rate could reach 1.0, making every kill at high player level a guaranteed coin spawn. Cap lowered to 0.95 so there's always a small whiff chance — drops feel earned instead of mechanical. Health drops keep their 1.0 cap (already gated by the global health cooldown).

---

## [5.74.9] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Gold Find now scales the money drop RATE, not just the amount.** Previously `getGoldFindMultiplier()` only multiplied the money budget in `dropOrbsFromEntity` (more coins per drop), but the per-kill probability of any drop was unaffected — so leveling up made each drop bigger but didn't make drops more frequent. The Gold Find multiplier (1 + (level − 1) × 0.05) is now also applied to `moneyDropRate` (clamped to 1.0). At level 10 the base 0.65 rate becomes ~0.94; at level 20 it's effectively guaranteed. Health drops are unchanged (Gold Find is a money stat).

---

## [5.74.8] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Powerup cards now have a hover effect** in the pause-menu POWERUPS tab. When the card is interactive (player has picks available), hovering lifts it 2px, swaps the background/border to a goldenrod tint with a soft glow, and pulses the inline `+1` chip pink. Owned cards keep their cyan accent on hover; locked cards (no picks) brighten back to full opacity to advertise that they're real, just-unbuyable powerups. Implemented via a new `.powerup-card--interactive` class added in `renderPowerupsOverlay` so cards without picks don't get a misleading "I can buy this" hover state.

---

## [5.74.7] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Orb size now reflects amount, not random.** `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_*` and `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_*` constants are now interpreted as **pixel radii** (was: multipliers), and the orb's actual radius is a linear map from `amount` (1..cap) to `[SIZE_MIN, SIZE_MAX]`. A 1-coin orb is `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MIN` px; a 20-coin orb is `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MAX` px; same for heal orbs. The `(z * 1.2 + 0.4) * scale * 3.2` random parallax baseRadius from `ColorStar.reset` is bypassed for collectibles (it produced a near-2× variance unrelated to amount, which is why bumping the SIZE constants previously had no visible effect on the biggest orbs). Render-path `sizeVariation` is also pinned to 1 on collectibles so SIZE_MIN/MAX are the sole controls. Defaults: heal orbs 6→18 px, money orbs 6→22 px.

---

## [5.74.6] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Auto Fire only fires when something is in range AND roughly on-aim.** Previously the assist held `input.fire = true` every tick, so the ship spammed bullets into empty space and (worse) interrupted nothing — but visually it never stopped. Now it gates each tick on `findNearestTarget(player.x, player.y, range)` where `range = primary.range × 400 × LONG_RANGE multiplier`, plus a ±25° aim cone (`dot ≥ cos(25°)`) so the target also has to be in front of the ship. Power-weapon auto-release inherits the same gate — charge-based weapons keep charging passively, but the release only triggers when `canHit && isFullyCharged`; cooldown-based ones fire when `canHit && isPowerReady()`.

---

## [5.74.5] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **POWERUPS pause-tab — entire card is now a click-to-buy hit target.** Previously only the small `+1` chip on the right end spent a Pick; clicking anywhere else on the row did nothing, which caused players to think purchases were broken when they tapped the card body. The card itself now carries the same purchase click handler (with `stopPropagation` + `preventDefault`) so clicking any part of the row spends one Pick and stacks the powerup. The `+1` chip still works for players who target it directly.

### Fixed
- **Auto Aim / Aim Assist no longer track regular enemy bullets.** `GameEngine.findNearestTarget` was walking every active enemy bullet, so the reticle would snap onto incoming projectiles the player can't actually destroy — yanking the aim around as bullets streamed past. Now restricted to enemies, asteroids, and `shape === 'mine'` / `'homing_mine'` enemy bullets (the destructible Tangerine bombs).

---

## [5.74.4] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Powerup picks were silently failing during the wave-clear pause.** The pause-overlay's `dismissOnBackdrop` listener used `e.target.closest('#pause-menu')` to decide whether a click was inside the menu. The POWERUPS tab `+1` buy button calls `purchasePowerup` → `renderPowerupsOverlay` → `replaceChildren()` synchronously inside its click handler, which detaches the original `<button>` before the click event finishes bubbling. `closest()` on a detached node walks a null parent chain and returns `null`, so the overlay treated the click as "outside the menu" and ran `togglePause` — which during a wave-clear pause routes through `_pausedFromWaveClear` straight into `startNextWave()`, closing the menu without applying the pick. (`stopPropagation()` on the buy button didn't always cover this path because the same bug exists for any in-menu control whose handler replaces its DOM ancestor.) Switched the dismiss check to a direct identity test (`e.target === e.currentTarget`) so only literal clicks on the overlay backdrop dismiss it.

### Changed
- **Assists tab — checkboxes vertically centered with their row text.** `.assist-row` is now `align-items: center` with `align-self: center` on the input, replacing the prior `flex-start` + 2px top margin that left the box visually drifting above the title.

---

## [5.74.3] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Gold is pickup-only.** Removed the silent `game.money += reward.points` increments that fired on every enemy kill (bullet-kill path, weapon-effect kill path, player-collision kill path), the per-asteroid collision-kill `+10`, the kill-streak coin milestone bonus (3/5/8/12/20 kills × 10), and the explosive-bullet AoE kill bonus. Killing an enemy now spawns its money-orb drops only — the player must fly over to grab them. Stops the "phantom +N" gold popups that fired several times per kill from these stacked award sites. XP gain on kill, score, and stats counters are unchanged. Wave-clear bonus, shop refund, run-complete bonus, the Tractor Shield deflect-for-coins skill payoff, and the cheat code are preserved as deliberate non-pickup income paths.

---

## [5.74.2] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Wave clear no longer auto-opens the shop.** The pause menu opens to the POWERUPS tab instead so the player can spend the +1 pick they just earned without being forced into the gold/SP economy. Pressing Resume (or ESC, or backdrop click) bridges through `togglePause` → `startNextWave` so the wave-gating behavior the shop used to provide is preserved. The pause menu's SHOP button still works during this window for players who want to visit the shop.
- **Money-orb base drop rate bumped 0.45 → 0.65.** Closer to the user-targeted ~0.65 baseline before powerup stacks, Gold Find, and hit-streak multipliers.

---

## [5.74.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Enemies no longer "stand around" when the player drifts away.** `ai.updateTargetPriority` was switching `currentTarget` to `'patrol'` whenever the player left the enemy's territory or crossed `loseInterestDistance`, which routed the AI through `patrolTerritory()` — a slow meander to a random point inside the enemy's own territory. Removed the territorial-patrol branch entirely; every enemy now permanently locks `currentTarget = 'player'` and runs its native movePattern (chase / arc / weaver-spinup / etc.) toward the player.

---

## [5.74.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Arrow-key aim & fire bindings.** Movement is now WASD-only; the arrow keys drive aim and fire. `←`/`→` rotate the ship's aim at a constant rate (~210°/s); `↑` mirrors L-click (primary fire); `↓` mirrors Space / R-click (charge / fire power weapon). Mouse aim still works — the ship resumes mouse aim the moment arrow keys are released.
- **Assists pause-menu tab.** New tab between POWERUPS and TIMER with three accessibility toggles, each persisted to `localStorage` (`rainboidsAssists`):
  - **Aim Assist** — when the cursor passes within 90 world-px of an enemy / asteroid / enemy bullet, the reticle snaps onto the target.
  - **Auto Aim** — overrides mouse and arrow aim every tick to track the nearest threat (enemies, asteroids, enemy bullets / mines).
  - **Auto Fire** — auto-presses primary every tick. For charge-based power weapons, holds `fireSecondary` true at full charge to release peak shots; for cooldown-based ones, fires the moment `isPowerReady()` returns true.
- **`GameEngine.findNearestTarget(x, y, maxDist)`** helper — walks `enemyPool`, `asteroidPool`, `enemyBulletPool` and returns the nearest active object's position. Used by both Aim Assist (snap radius) and Auto Aim (unbounded).

### Changed
- **CONTROLS pause-tab** now lists arrow-key aim/fire alongside mouse/click bindings. WASD shown as the sole movement binding.
- **Pause-tab grid** moved from 4 columns to 3 columns to accommodate the 9 tabs cleanly (3×3).

---

## [5.73.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Gold Find player stat.** New `Player.getGoldFindMultiplier()` returning `1 + (level - 1) × 0.05`. Applied as a multiplier on the money-orb budget in `dropOrbsFromEntity` — both the gold AMOUNT per drop and the SYMBOL COUNT (post-split) scale with player level. Level 5 = 1.20×, level 10 = 1.45×, level 20 = 1.95×.
- **"+5% Gold Find" advertised on every level-up** alongside the existing +1 SP / +1 Pick / temp bonuses. Level-up subtitle now reads `+1 Skill Point  +1 Powerup Pick  +5% Gold Find` so the player sees the stat tick up.
- **Player-anchored gold popup**. The gold "+N" arc now spawns at TWO points per gain — at the bottom-right gold counter AND directly over the player's ship — so the feedback reads from both the action zone and the corner readout.
- **Homing bullets target enemy mines (Tangerine bombs).** `applyHoming` now also walks `enemyBulletPool` filtered to `shape === 'mine'` after enemies/asteroids are exhausted. Mines have HP and can be destroyed; this lets players "shoot the bombs."

### Changed
- **POWERUPS tab moved from shop to pause menu.** Shop is now strictly the gold + SP economy (HELP / PRIMARY / POWER / DEFENSE). The pause menu's POWERUPS tab gained a per-card "+1" buy button + a top banner showing the unspent Pick count. Buys decrement `player.powerupPicks` and call `addPowerup`. CSS picks-banner styling added.
- **Money-orb base drop rate bumped 0.20 → 0.45.** Gold drops are roughly 2.25× more frequent baseline, before powerup stacks / Gold Find / hit-streak multipliers.
- **Gold popup arc trajectory.** Was straight-up float + decel. Now spawns with a horizontal velocity component and a gravity term (`vx: ±2.4, vy: -3.6, gravity: 0.18`) so the popup describes a parabolic arc instead of a vertical line. Each popup also scale-pulses (1 → 1.25) at spawn for poppy emphasis.
- **Gold counter flash on every gain.** 280 ms bell-curve flash where the text scale-pulses (×1.18) and tints from gold to white-hot, with a soft glow that decays through the window. Visible without being subtle.
- **Old `drawMoneyPickupDisplay()` disabled.** Was rendering a stray "+N" at the obsolete top-left coin position (rogue popup the user spotted). Removed from the draw loop; the new `goldPopups` system replaces it.
- **HP scaling much steeper from wave 5.** Both enemy and asteroid HP curves linearised (exponent 1.6/1.5 → 1.0) with higher ceilings (4.5/4.0 → 6.5). Wave-5 enemies now ~2.4× HP (was 1.37×); wave-5 asteroids ~3.9× (was 1.94×); wave-20 enemies ~7.5× (was 5.5×).

---

## [5.72.2] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Wave-clear bonus never fired in actual gameplay.** The XP / coins / +1 powerup pick / "WAVE N CLEARED" notification all lived in `wave-manager.completeWave()`, which has been dead code in the live loop since the shop-gated wave system was introduced — only tests and the dev console call it. Players never got the +1 pick they were promised, and the bonus message never showed. Inlined the bonus directly into `updateWaveSystem()` so every wave clear in real gameplay grants `+20+(wave×10) XP`, `+50+(wave×25) coins`, and `+1 powerup pick`.

### Added
- **Animated gold readout.** The bottom-right gold counter now:
  - Spawns a "+N" popup near the readout on every gain (mirrors the damage-number popup style — gold colour, 16px bold, floats up + fades over ~1.1 s, slight x-jitter so back-to-back popups don't perfectly stack).
  - Rolls toward the real value like a casino slot reel — 18% lerp per frame with a min step of 2 so small trickles finish quickly, large bonuses (wave clear) roll visibly. While rolling, the counter gets a subtle gold glow.

### Changed
- **WAVE COMPLETE banner gets a clean window before the shop.** Bumped the auto-shop delay from 2000 ms → 2700 ms so the banner has ~700 ms of clear screen after its fade-out finishes, before the shop overlay covers the canvas.

---

## [5.72.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Healthbar lost its color gradient.** When the bar moved bottom-anchored in 5.72.0, the cached `LinearGradient` (created with hardcoded coordinates `60, 20, 60, 50` for the old top-left position) was rendered above the bar's new screen position — bar appeared flat / unfilled. Cache key now includes `barY` so the gradient is regenerated when the bar moves. Bar reads correctly again at any anchor.
- **Loadout squares overlapped the healthbar.** The 14 px gap between loadout-square bottom and bar top was too tight; rounded corners crashed into the bar's top edge. Bumped to 32 px (now moot — see HUD reshuffle below — but the constant is correct for any future layout that puts loadout above the bar).

### Changed
- **Shop always lands on POWERUPS tab.** Was: `POWERUPS` if any unspent picks, `HELP` otherwise. The HELP fallback never matched the player's intent — they're opening the shop to spend, not to read instructions. POWERUPS is the canonical entry tab now.
- **TIMER tab moved from shop to pause menu.** Builds the same speedrun-tier reference card (label / finish-under / multiplier columns + live elapsed-time readout). The shop is now build-mode only; the timer reference is meta information that fits the pause menu better.
- **HUD reshuffle (final, post-iteration):**
  - Minimap: **commented out** (per user request — was top-left after 5.72.0 toggling, now disabled entirely).
  - Healthbar / triforce / LV shield / level number / heart+HP text → **back to top-left** (5.72.0 moved them BL; this restores the original top-left layout).
  - Weapon + skill loadout squares (PRM / PWR / SKL) → **stay in bottom-left**, anchored independently to canvas bottom (no longer relative to the bar).
  - Pause + shop buttons → **bottom-middle** along the bottom edge (was bottom-right above timer). Centered around screen midline with a 12 px gap.
  - Killstreak indicator → still bottom-center, but raised to clear the pause+shop buttons (`y = canvas.height - 180`).
  - Gold above timer in BR + powerup-icon vertical column on right edge — unchanged.

---

## [5.72.0] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Powerups capped at 1 stack** — every powerup in the new POWERUPS shop tab refused a second purchase. POWERUP_TYPES doesn't define `maxStacks` per entry, and `_buildPowerupsTabItems` was defaulting to 1. Bumped the default to 99 (effectively unlimited within a run); per-powerup tuning can land later if specific powerups need real caps.
- **Enemies warped across the screen at high waves.** Compound speed was 4.34× base at wave 20 (campaign mul 2.55 × level mul 1.70). Reduced both ceilings: campaign mul cap 2.55 → 1.75, per-level speed mul cap 1.70 → 1.40. New worst-case wave-20 speed: ~2.45× base.
- **GAME COMPLETE title was oversized**, dwarfing the stats below it. Cut roughly 40% (110→64 cap, 64→40 floor, screen-width divisor 14→22).

### Changed
- **Level-up no longer auto-opens the shop.** The 5.71.0 auto-open was disruptive — every level threshold during a fight pre-empted gameplay. Picks accumulate silently; the shop opens only at wave-end now.
- **XP curve drastically slowed.** Base `experienceToNextLevel` 100 → 400, exponent 1.5 → 1.7, per-kill XP `points/3` → `points/6`. Combined effect: leveling drops from ~1/wave to ~1 every 2-3 waves.
- **Shop landing tab simplified.** Removed the 5.70.0 random-tab fallback (PRIMARY / POWER / DEFENSE). Now: POWERUPS if the player has unspent picks, HELP otherwise.
- **HUD reshuffle (again — final layout):**
  - Minimap → **top-left** (was bottom-left in 5.71.0).
  - Healthbar / lives stack → **bottom-left**. Triforce sits LEFT of the bar; LV shield + level number sits to the RIGHT of the bar on the same row (was below it); heart icon + HP text below.
  - Loadout squares (PRM / PWR / SKL) → directly **above** the healthbar (was below the coins display).
  - Gold readout → **bottom-right above timer** (was below healthbar). New `drawBottomRightGold(ctx)` in `hud/status.js`.
  - Powerup-stack icons → **right edge, vertical column** (was top-right horizontal). When a column fills, the next icon wraps to a new column to the LEFT. Top reserve = 20 px, bottom reserve = 110 px so the column never overlaps gold + timer.
  - Killstreak indicator → **bottom-center** (was top-right). Centered alignment, sits above the timer/gold lane.
  - LEVEL X! announce → **upper third** of screen (was near bottom). Avoids overlap with the bottom-center killstreak.

---

## [5.71.0] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Game froze on shop close from mid-wave.** Pressing Escape (or the X button) on a shop opened during PLAYING hid the shop overlay but left `game.state === 'SHOP'`. The state machine's transition table was missing `SHOP → PLAYING` — `closeShopToPlaying()` was calling `this.game.state = PLAYING`, the validator silently rejected the transition with `[GameState] Invalid transition: SHOP → PLAYING`, and the game loop (gated on PLAYING/WAVE_TRANSITION) stopped updating entities. Added `PLAYING` to the SHOP row in `TRANSITION_TABLE` (game-state.js).

### Added
- **Shop auto-opens on level-up** — `progression.levelUp()` now schedules `openShop()` ~700 ms after the level-up animation, mirroring the wave-end auto-shop. Skips if state is no longer PLAYING / WAVE_TRANSITION (e.g. player died mid-animation). The auto-open uses the existing "land on POWERUPS if any unspent picks" logic, so the player goes straight to the build choice.
- **TIMER shop tab.** New info-only tab showing a live elapsed-time readout and the speedrun multiplier reference card. Tier table:
  ```
  GODLIKE      <  5:00     5.0×
  LEGENDARY    <  7:30     4.0×
  UNSTOPPABLE  < 10:00     3.0×
  EMPOWERED    < 12:30     2.5×
  STEADY       < 15:00     2.0×
  CASUAL       < 20:00     1.5×
  FINISHED     ≥ 20:00     1.0×
  ```
  Constants live in `core/constants.js` (`SPEEDRUN_TIERS`, `speedrunTierFor()`) so the Game Complete screen can apply them later. The current row highlights based on the live elapsed time, so the player can see what tier they're chasing in-shop.
- **Big `+` sigil for the PICKS currency.** Replaces the ⚡ icon — bigger, bolder, pink (#ff66cc) with a soft glow. Reads as "free pick" rather than as a numeric cost. Applies to both the shop header counter and the per-row price display.

### Changed
- **HUD layout reshuffled.** Cleaner left/right edge use:
  - Powerup-stack icons → **top-right** (was bottom-left). Stack right-to-left so the rightmost slot is the first powerup; new ones push leftward.
  - Run timer → **bottom-right** (was bottom-left). Right-aligned now: text hugs the right margin, stopwatch icon sits to its left.
  - Minimap → **bottom-left** (was bottom-right). Spawn-avoidance region in `wave-manager.js` updated to match.
  - HUD shop + pause buttons → **bottom-right**, above the timer (was top-right). Bottom offset 70 px clears the timer row.
- **Green health orbs are now mechanically identical to powerups.** They drift gently toward the player with the powerup-style soft magnet (k = 0.55× — same three-tier shape as money orbs but scaled), tick down their `life` counter, and fade out via the existing 120-frame opacity ramp before pool release. Money orbs keep the full-strength magnetic pull (k = 1.0) so coins still snap to the player. Tractor beam pulls both.

---

## [5.70.0] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Powerup acquisition reworked end-to-end.** Powerups no longer drop from enemy or asteroid kills. Instead, the player earns **Powerup Picks** — a new currency — and spends them in the shop's new **POWERUPS** tab on whichever powerup they want. This gives every run a deliberate, custom build path:
  - **+1 Pick per wave clear** (alongside the existing XP + coins bonus).
  - **+1 Pick per player level-up** (asteroid kills now meaningfully shape the build because XP feeds directly into more picks).
  - Picks accumulate; skipping a shop visit doesn't waste them.
  - All 20 powerup types are purchasable. Each costs 1 Pick. Per-powerup `maxStacks` limits still apply.
  - Picks-currency items are non-refundable (no SELL button) — keeps the build choice meaningful and prevents churn-farming the same stack.
- **Shop auto-opens on the POWERUPS tab when the player has unspent Picks.** Otherwise it falls back to the old random-tab landing (PRIMARY / POWER / DEFENSE) so the open still feels fresh.
- **Money orbs keep their magnetic three-tier pull. Health (green) orbs no longer auto-home** — they drift with their burst velocity + ORB_FRIC drag, and the player has to fly close to collect them. Makes the asteroids-vs-enemies trade-off more deliberate (you commit to flying over there for the heal).

### Added
- **`Player.powerupPicks` field** + grant logic in `wave-manager.js completeWave()` and `progression.js levelUp()`.
- **`POWERUPS` shop category** (`shop-manager._buildPowerupsTabItems`) listing every entry in `POWERUP_TYPES` with currency `'PICKS'`.
- **`PICKS` currency support in `buyShopItem`** — affordability check, decrement, and the existing `addPowerup()` hook handles the rest of the player-state side.
- **Shop UI:** new `<button class="shop-tab" data-tab="POWERUPS">` in `index.html`, new `shop-currency--picks` counter in the header, new `shop-item-price--picks` style for the per-row cost. CSS picks accent: `#ff66cc`.
- **HELP-tab content updated** to introduce Picks alongside Gold / SP / XP, and to clarify the new "asteroid kills feed into XP feeds into Picks" loop.

### Removed
- All `dropPowerup()` calls from kill paths in `collision-system.js` (small + large asteroid splits, enemy bullet-kill, `destroyAsteroid()`, `damageEnemy()` death path). The function itself remains because the `P` debug cheat still uses it to spawn a test pickup.
- `COLLISION_CONFIG.POWERUP_DROP_CHANCE` constants are now unreferenced from kill paths (kept in `constants.js` for now in case the cheat or a future event-drop re-adopts them).

---

## [5.69.4] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **Enemy destruction sounds redesigned around a multi-band spectrum.** Earlier passes oscillated between two extremes — 5.69.2 was 87-98% sub-bass (massive thump on a woofer, inaudible on laptops); 5.69.3 was 1-6% sub-bass (audible everywhere but lacking weight on real subwoofers). 5.69.4 uses 3-layer designs that span both bands so the sounds work on either:
  - **L1 sub-bass** — sine ~80-180 Hz (`p_base_freq: 0.07-0.18`), no HPF, hard `p_env_punch: 0.7-0.9`. Provides chest-thump on woofers and good headphones; transparent on small speakers (they pass through silently).
  - **L2 mid body** — square ~420-550 Hz (`p_base_freq: 0.42-0.55`) with gentle `p_freq_ramp: -0.16 to -0.22` keeping the descent above 250 Hz. The "main" audible body across every speaker.
  - **L3 mid noise rumble** — broadband noise with `p_hpf_freq: 0.18-0.24` cutting its own sub overlap with L1 while keeping 400 Hz – 3 kHz texture for crackle/fireball feel.
- Per-user request, intentionally minimised bright high content (no HPF chirp tail). Energy concentrates in sub + low-mid + mid bands, reading as "weighty boom" rather than "sharp pop." Each variant retains its character signature (vibrato for WEAVER, phaser for STALKER, repeat-stutter shrapnel for PROWLER, freq_dramp for TANGERINE, etc.).
- **Post-fix spectral distribution** (sliding-window FFT over full clip):
  ```
  band         5.69.2     5.69.3     5.69.4
  sub-bass     87-98%     1.5-6%     14-60%   ← woofer thump restored
  bass         1-5%       0.4-17%    0.3-1.2%
  low-mid      0.2-7%     19-50%     17-34%   ← strong audible
  mid          0.1-1%     14-48%     9-20%    ← strong audible
  hmid+high    0-0.7%     19-47%     5-25%    ← dialled back per user req
  ```

### Added
- **`tools/scripts/sound/`** — diagnostic scripts for the SFXR audio pipeline. Four tools, all preserved from the 5.68.10 / 5.69.x debugging sessions:
  - `check-wavs.mjs` — peak / RMS / nonzero-sample audit per WAV (catches silent files).
  - `spectrum.mjs` — per-WAV sliding-window FFT lumped into 6 frequency bands (catches band-mismatch issues like the 5.69.2 sub-bass concentration bug).
  - `probe-event-dispatch.spec.js` — Playwright probe verifying `audio:enemy-destroy` → `playSound('enemyDestroy_<TYPE>')` end-to-end.
  - `probe-playsound-internals.spec.js` — Playwright probe instrumenting every step inside `playSound` (manifest hit, throttle, buffer lookup, `src.start()`, `src.onended`).
  - Includes a README documenting usage and the bug history each script was written to investigate.

### Internal
- 5.69.3 destruction WAVs preserved as `sfx/enemyDestroy*.wav.bak` for A/B reference.

---

## [5.69.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Enemy destruction sounds were inaudible because their energy lived below 150 Hz.** A spectrogram audit revealed that 5.69.2's destruction WAVs concentrated **87–98% of their acoustic energy in sub-bass (<150 Hz)** — a band most laptop and phone speakers physically cannot reproduce. Even though peak amplitudes were correct (-0.4 dB), the speakers were filtering all the content out. A runtime probe of `playSound()` confirmed every destruction was being queued correctly through the BufferSource → GainNode → AudioContext.destination chain (`onended` callbacks fired for each), and `audioContext.state` was `running` — the audio was playing, the user just couldn't hear it. The problem wasn't the dispatch; it was that I had designed the sounds for full-range studio monitors instead of integrated laptop / phone speakers.
- **Energy redistributed into the audible 400 Hz–3 kHz band.** Body layers moved from `p_base_freq: 0.08-0.22` (≈80-220 Hz) up to `0.42-0.6` (≈420-600 Hz). Frequency ramps gentled from `-0.30 to -0.42` to `-0.16 to -0.22` so the descent stays above 250 Hz instead of dropping into the inaudible sub. Mid noise layers got higher HPF cutoffs (`p_hpf_freq: 0.22-0.28`) to drop their own sub-bass content. Tail layers raised to `0.65-0.72` base freq (~750 Hz) with HPF 0.28-0.36 so they sit firmly in the high-mid where every speaker reads them.
- **Post-fix spectral distribution** (sliding-window FFT over full clip):
  ```
  band            5.69.2     5.69.3
  sub-bass        87-98%     1.5-6%      ← speakers can render now
  bass            1-5%       0.4-17%
  low-mid         0.2-7%     19-50%      ← strong audible content
  mid             0.1-1%     14-48%      ← strong audible content
  high-mid        0-0.5%     13-25%
  high            0-0.2%     6-22%
  ```
- **Caught a smaller bug**: `collision-system.js` had two `audio:enemy-destroy` emit sites, only one was passing `enemy.type` (line 523). The second (in `damageEnemy`, line 1455) was emitting with no payload, falling back to the generic `enemyDestroy` clip even for typed enemies. Both sites now pass `enemy.type`.

### Internal
- Diagnosed via two probes (intercepted `events.emit` + instrumented `playSound`) and a sliding-window FFT spectrum audit per WAV. Probes lived in `tests/qa/99-*` during diagnosis and have been removed; spectrum script is one-shot and not committed.

---

## [5.69.2] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Enemy destruction sounds were inaudible despite firing correctly.** A runtime probe (intercepting `events.emit` and `audioManager.playSound`) confirmed `audio:enemy-destroy` fires with `enemy.type` and `playSound('enemyDestroy_<TYPE>')` is called for every kill — the dispatch chain was correct end-to-end. The actual problem was **perceptual masking**: the 5.69.1 destruction sounds were too brief (HUNTER 79 ms, WASP 88 ms) and spectrally too similar to the `hit` tick that fires on the same frame, so the ear merged them into a single percussive event. **Fix:** rewrote all 11 destruction defs around four explicit perceptibility principles —
  - **Sub-bass anchor** — every body layer now sits at `p_base_freq: 0.08-0.22` so the destruction is spectrally distinct from the high-frequency hit it overlaps with.
  - **Long tails** — minimum ~320 ms even for HUNTER and WASP (was 79 ms / 88 ms). Below that threshold the sound is masked by surrounding gunfire.
  - **Hard envelope punch** — `p_env_punch: 0.65–0.85` on every body layer. Punch boosts the attack peak ~2× for ~10 ms, the critical "BOOM" character.
  - **Rumble stutter** — `p_repeat_speed: 0.32–0.55` on the body of every variant. Even a small stutter makes the sound read as "explosive" rather than "single tonal pop."
- New durations: HUNTER 327 ms, WASP 320 ms, DRIFTER 454 ms, WEAVER 474 ms, TANGERINE 533 ms, STALKER 625 ms, generic `enemyDestroy` 759 ms, SENTINEL 795 ms, PROWLER 907 ms, GUARDIAN 1241 ms, TITAN 1557 ms — all peak-normalized to −0.4 dB with 99-100% nonzero samples.

---

## [5.69.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Per-enemy destruction sounds.** Each of the 10 enemy types now has its own SFXR-rendered destruction clip — `enemyDestroy_HUNTER` through `enemyDestroy_TITAN` — tuned to the ship's mass and fighting character. Length scales from ~80 ms (HUNTER, WASP) up to ~1 s (TITAN). Per-enemy variants:
  - **HUNTER** — sharp pop with brief HPF chirp tail (light/agile).
  - **GUARDIAN** — deep slow boom, longest decay (~760 ms), rolling square arp tail (heavy/armored).
  - **WASP** — tinny stutter pop with `p_repeat_speed` chitter (small/electric).
  - **STALKER** — phaser-modulated body with vibrato HPF tail (charged-laser energy).
  - **DRIFTER** — heavy stuttered noise + arp square zap (arc-lightning crackle).
  - **PROWLER** — massive sub thump + stuttered "shrapnel" square (missile-launcher).
  - **WEAVER** — vibrato sine collapse, most tonal in the set (spiral-laser whorl).
  - **SENTINEL** — square-dominant with `p_duty_ramp` for "machinery winding down" feel.
  - **TANGERINE** — rising-then-falling HPF chirp with `p_freq_dramp` (energy core overload).
  - **TITAN** — cataclysmic ~1 s multi-stage with `p_repeat_speed` rolling thunder, longest in the library (boss-tier).

### Changed
- **Generic `enemyDestroy` rebuilt from scratch around a 3-phase classical explosion architecture**: phase-1 HPF transient (5-15 ms crack), phase-2 sub-bass body with vibrato + hard envelope punch (BWOOOM), phase-3 descending noise rumble (fireball), phase-4 square arp tail with `p_arp_mod` negative (debris fall-off). Now also serves as the registered fallback when a new enemy type is added without a per-enemy clip.
- **`audio:enemy-destroy` event now carries `enemy.type`** as its payload. The dispatch in `game-engine.js` tries `enemyDestroy_<TYPE>` first and falls back to `enemyDestroy` via `audioManager.playSound()`'s boolean return — graceful degrade for unknown types.
- **Per-enemy throttle windows** added to `audio-manager.js`: 40 ms (HUNTER, WASP) → 200 ms (TITAN). Heavy ships need wider gaps to avoid thunder-on-thunder when chain-killed; light ships keep the tight default so kill-streaks still pop crisply.

---

## [5.69.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **11 new jsfxr sound definitions in `sound-defs.js`** filling every gap that previously routed to a Kenney mp3:
  - **Destruction** — `asteroidDestroy` (3-layer noise rumble + low square thump + HPF debris crackle), `enemyDestroy` (3-layer sub-bass thump + descending square pop + ascending HPF zap chirp).
  - **Defense skill activations** — `bulwark` (sub thump + sustained square hum), `repairNanites` (ascending sine arp + HPF shimmer), `phaseDash` (noise sweep + rising sine glide), `deflectorOrbs` (sine bell + HPF shimmer), `empPulse` (3-layer noise burst + descending square + rising HPF chirp), `tractorShield` (vibrato beam + slow square harmonic).
  - **Per-weapon hit** — `playerHit_LIGHTNING_ARC` (3-layer noise crackle + arp square + HPF chirp).
  - **Generic enemy-bullet-hit fallback** — `enemyHit` (light kinetic tick) for patterns without a dedicated `enemyHit_*` clip.
- **`menuClick` UI tick** — short HPF square blip pre-rendered as `sfx/menuClick.wav`. A new delegated capture-phase click listener in `UIManager.setupEventListeners()` plays it on every button-shaped element across the document (button, a, [role="button"], plus the project's tab/card/shop classes), with explicit opt-out via `data-no-click-sound` and an automatic skip for canvas clicks (gameplay input). Throttled to 50 ms so multi-click streaks don't buzz.

### Changed
- **All SFX are now SFXR-generated; every Kenney mp3 has been removed from `sfx/`.** The `audio-manager.js` MANIFEST is rewritten to reference only `.wav` files generated from `sound-defs.js`. 62 Kenney mp3s, the `Digital_SFX_Set.zip` source archive, and the Kenney `readme.txt` were deleted from `sfx/`. The `sfx/` directory now contains 37 WAVs + `manifest.json` only.
- **`asteroidDestroy` / `enemyDestroy` shape simplified.** Previously these were layered-bucket entries that picked one of several pre-mixed Kenney layer combinations per play. Now each is a single jsfxr WAV that's already 3-layer mixed offline — same per-call layered feel, less runtime work.
- **`UIManager.setupEventListeners()` is now invoked from `setAudioManager()`.** Was previously a placeholder that nothing called.

### Removed
- **`playerHitBullet` MANIFEST entry and throttle** — the name was never fired by any code path; the only paths reach `enemyHit_<pattern>` (specific) or `enemyHit` (generic fallback).
- **Kenney's Digital SFX assets** — 62 mp3 files, the Digital_SFX_Set.zip archive, and `sfx/readme.txt` (license attribution for the now-removed pack).

---

## [5.68.10] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **All 26 jsfxr-generated WAVs were SILENT.** The 5.68.7 generator was passing partial params objects (only the fields each `sound-defs.js` entry chose to override) directly into `new SoundEffect(params)`. jsfxr's `Params` class defaults `p_lpf_freq` to `1` (low-pass wide open); when undefined, the engine treats it as `0` and runs every sample through a 0 Hz LPF — output is zero. Same trap affects every `p_*` field with a non-zero default. Files were the right length and format on disk (so `decodeAudioData` succeeded silently), but every single sample was 0. Confirmed via byte-level WAV audit: peak=0 and nonzero=0 across all 26 files. **Fix:** `tools/scripts/generate-sfx.js` now merges each layer's params onto a fresh `new Params()` so all 27 fields inherit jsfxr's documented defaults; partial fields override only what the def specifies. After regen, every WAV peaks between −9.4 dB and −0.4 dB with 99–100% nonzero samples — audible signal restored.

### Internal
- Verified by reading raw 16-bit PCM samples post-regeneration and tabulating peak / RMS / nonzero ratio per file. Audit script lives only in `/tmp/`; the production generator emits the same files via `npm run generate-sfx`.

---

## [5.68.9] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Defense skills were silent on activation.** `activateSkill()` in `skills.js` set the cooldown and effect-timer but never asked the audio manager for a clip — so BULWARK / REPAIR_NANITES / PHASE_DASH / DEFLECTOR_ORBS / EMP_PULSE / TRACTOR_SHIELD all played zero sound when the player triggered them. A `SKILL_ACTIVATE_SOUND` map now routes each skill id → its corresponding manifest entry (`bulwark`, `repairNanites`, `phaseDash`, `deflectorOrbs`, `empPulse`, `tractorShield`), with a `shield` fallback if a specific clip isn't registered.

### Changed
- **Default SFX volume bumped 0.5 → 0.8** (`AudioManager.sfxMasterVol`). Freshly-installed builds were quiet enough that several layered jsfxr clips read as inaudible against the music; the slider still tops out at 1.0, so headroom is unchanged.
- **Throttles loosened on high-rate events.** Per-name min-interval-ms tightened so back-to-back sounds aren't dropped into silence: `shoot` 40 → 30, `hit` 60 → 40, `enemyHit` 60 → 40, `explosion` 80 → 60, `playerHitBullet` 80 → 60. Per-weapon and per-pattern variants continue to use the 30 ms default.

---

## [5.68.8] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **SFX slider was still showing/applying the old 0–20% cap.** `updateSfxVolumeDisplay()` in `ui-manager.js` was multiplying the slider value by `0.2` for display (leftover from when `maxSfxVolume = 0.2`). The audio-manager's actual cap was lifted to 1.0 in 5.68.6, but the UI was still telling users their max was 20%. Now: slider 0–100% maps directly to the displayed percentage AND to the gain 0..1.

---

## [5.68.7] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **jsfxr SFX pipeline restored.** The original layered-sfxr offline generator is back:
  - `js/modules/audio/sound-defs.js` — 22 named sounds, each defined as 2-3 stacked sfxr voices (low body + mid impact + high sparkle / sweep, etc.). Single source of truth for the SFX library.
  - `tools/scripts/generate-sfx.js` — Node script that renders every entry in `SOUND_DEFS` to `/sfx/<name>.wav`, peak-normalized to -0.45 dB, mono 16-bit PCM at 44.1 kHz. Layered defs are sum-mixed before normalization. Writes a `manifest.json` alongside the WAVs.
  - **Run with**: `npm run generate-sfx` (script already wired in package.json).
- **26 jsfxr WAVs generated** (~904 KB total) covering: shoot, hit, coin, powerup, healthRegen, shield, tractorBeam, explosion, playerExplosion, playerHitAsteroid, playerHitEnemy, 5 per-weapon `playerHit_*` clips, and 10 per-firing-pattern `enemyHit_*` clips.

### Changed
- **`audio-manager.js` MANIFEST repointed at jsfxr WAVs as the primary set.** Kenney's Digital SFX clips remain for sounds the jsfxr defs don't cover (asteroid/enemy destruction layered pools, defense-skill activations, generic enemy-bullet-hit fallback, Lightning Arc weapon-hit). Result: the gameplay-critical sounds (firing, generic explosions, pickups, hits) are now from the layered jsfxr generator that gives a coherent futuristic synthetic vocabulary; Kenney accents fill the remaining gaps.

### Internal
- The audio-manager's existing layered-bucket playback path (`1/√N` per-layer gain bias) handles Kenney layered pools (asteroidDestroy, enemyDestroy, ram impacts) unchanged. jsfxr WAVs are pre-mixed offline, so they're single-file entries.

---

## [5.68.6] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **SFX volume cap removed.** `maxSfxVolume = 0.2 → 1.0`; the slider now maps directly to gain `0..1` instead of being clipped to a fifth of master. Default boots at 50% slider position. Old default was inaudible-quiet for combat with the new layered destruction sounds.
- **Asteroid + enemy destruction get layered sounds.** Manifest entries can now be EITHER a flat string array (pick one random clip) OR a layered-bucket array (pick one bucket, play ALL files in it simultaneously). Per-bucket gain is `1/√N` to keep peaks in check.
  - **`asteroidDestroy`** — rocky shatter pools combining `spaceTrash` crash with descending tones (`lowDown`, `phaserDown1/3`, `zapThreeToneDown`).
  - **`enemyDestroy`** — energy detonation pools layering `spaceTrash` + `zap1/2`/`zapTwoTone`/`zapThreeToneDown` + `lowDown`/`phaserDown1/2` for the "ship blowing apart" signature.
  - **`playerExplosion`** — heaviest layered booms (3-layer `spaceTrash5 + lowDown + phaserDown3`).
  - **`playerHitAsteroid` / `playerHitEnemy`** — collision rams now layered (`lowDown + spaceTrash2`, `lowRandom + zap1`) for proper thud + texture.
- **New events** `audio:asteroid-destroy` and `audio:enemy-destroy` fired from `collision-system.js` at the kill sites (small/large asteroid path, single-bullet kill path, and the unified `destroyAsteroid` / enemy-kill path). Generic `audio:explosion` stays for mines and missile detonations.

---

## [5.68.5] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Sound effects wired up.** `audio-manager.js` was a no-op shell since the jsfxr removal; it now loads Kenney's Digital SFX set from `sfx/` and plays an appropriate clip per gameplay event.
  - **Manifest** maps logical sound names → arrays of mp3 file paths. Names with multiple entries pick a random clip per play, so rapid-fire events get pleasant variation instead of buzz-saw repetition.
  - **Throttle** (`SOUND_THROTTLE_MS`) prevents the same sound from stacking on top of itself when events fire faster than the human ear can distinguish (Storm Needles at 130ms cadence, per-frame Lance Beam contact, etc).
  - **Per-weapon enemy-hit sounds**: pulse-cannon laser, storm-needles laser, scatter-gun crash, rail-driver zap, lance-beam zap, lightning-arc two-tone zap. Falls back to a generic hit clip if no per-weapon clip is registered.
  - Mappings (logical name → file): `shoot` → laser1-3, `explosion` → spaceTrash1/3/4, `playerExplosion` → spaceTrash5/lowDown, `coin` → pepSound2, `powerup` → powerUp3/7/10, `healthRegen` → powerUp1/4, `shield` → phaseJump1, `playerHitAsteroid` → lowDown, `playerHitEnemy` → lowRandom, plus skill-specific (phaseDash, bulwark, empPulse, deflectorOrbs, repairNanites, tractorShield, tractorBeam).
- **`playSound()` now returns a boolean** — true if the name exists in MANIFEST, false otherwise. Lets callers do specific→generic fallback (per-weapon hit → generic hit) without leaking knowledge of the manifest into the dispatch.

### Changed
- **SFX volume baseline bumped** `0.1 → 0.25` (default), max `0.2 → 0.5`. Old values were tuned for the silent stub; with real audio loaded the floor needs to be audible.
- **`game-engine.js` audio dispatcher** rewritten for `audio:player-hit-bullet` and `audio:enemy-hit-by-bullet` to use the new `playSound()` boolean fallback path. The old dispatcher checked `audioManager.sounds[name]` which never existed.

---

## [5.68.4] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Q activates the equipped defense skill** (was TAB in 5.64.14–5.68.3). Sits naturally under the left hand on WASD — no pinky stretch. TAB is no longer a game binding (still `preventDefault`'d so an accidental TAB doesn't shift browser focus off the canvas).
- Updated `input-handler.js` (keydown), `event-setup.js` comment, `ui-manager.js` controls tab, `index.html` static controls list, the `wave1-fire-and-skill-v5` tutorial hint, and the README controls section.

---

## [5.68.3] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Cycle keybinds rotated.** Mapping is now:
  - **E** — cycle defense skill (was: cycle primary).
  - **R** — cycle primary weapon (was: cycle power).
  - **F** — cycle power weapon (was: cycle skill).
  - All three keys still HOLD-to-open-radial as before; only the assignment to weapon/skill type changed. Updated in `event-setup.js` (keydown / keyup wiring), `index.html` controls list, the `wave1-cycle-weapons-v5` tutorial hint text, the `input-handler.js` comment block, and the README controls section.

---

## [5.68.2] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Hint overlay auto-dims when it overlaps gameplay.** If the player ship or the mouse cursor enters the tooltip's bounding rect (with a 24px buffer), the overlay drops to `opacity: 0.18` so it doesn't obscure action; lifts back to full when both leave. Driven by a new `updateHintDimming(playerScreenX, playerScreenY, playerRadius, mouseScreenX, mouseScreenY)` export from `hint-system.js`, called every frame from the engine update loop.

---

## [5.68.1] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Enemy bullet speed decoupled from enemy movement and bumped at the floor.** New curve `1.15 + ((w-1)/19)^1.4 × 1.9` (waves 1→20: `1.15, 1.37, 1.83, 2.40, 3.05`). Wave 1 bullets are now ~2× faster than before (was `0.55×`); wave 20 bullets ~20% faster (was `2.55×`). Enemy MOVEMENT keeps its gentler `0.55..2.55` ramp so wave 1 still teaches positioning while bullets actually feel threatening.
- **Primary-weapon DPS rebalance.** All primaries now sit at ~3.0 DPS baseline (previously a 2.0–2.5 spread); Pulse Cannon got the biggest buff so the starter weapon doesn't feel anaemic.
  - PULSE_CANNON: damage `0.8 → 1.2` (DPS `2.00 → 3.00`).
  - STORM_NEEDLES: damage `0.30 → 0.40` (DPS `2.31 → 3.08`).
  - SCATTER_GUN: per-pellet damage `0.40 → 0.42` (5-pellet point-blank DPS `2.86 → 3.00`).
  - LANCE_BEAM: per-frame damage `0.034 → 0.05` (DPS `2.04 → 3.00`).
  - LIGHTNING_ARC: per-frame damage `0.034 → 0.05` (DPS `2.04 → 3.00`).
  - RAIL_DRIVER unchanged (`2.50` single / up to `5.00` with both helix bullets hitting).
- **Pause-menu CONTROLS tab rewritten.** The dynamic `updateControlsTab()` in `ui-manager.js` was still using the pre-5.64.14 layout with a "1 – 4 Defense skills" line. Replaced with the current keybind layout (E/R/F on one line; "hold to open radial menu" hint).

---

## [5.68.0] - 2026-05-04

### Merged
- **`webgl-starfield` branch landed** (5.64.16 → 5.64.18). Brings in the WebGL starfield layer and the brightness/dynamism passes. The branch had diverged from master at `dbf6026` (5.64.13) and the `radial-menus` work (5.65.0 → 5.67.1) landed on master in parallel; this merge unifies both feature lines. Resolved minor conflicts in `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md`; `game-engine.js` auto-merged cleanly.

---

## [5.67.1] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Missile Salvo missiles spread across distinct targets.** At launch each missile is pre-assigned its own target (nearest-first enemy assignment, asteroid fallback), so a 3-missile salvo never stacks on the closest enemy when two more are right there. Re-acquisition (when a missile's target dies mid-flight) also prefers targets no other live missile is currently locked onto, falling back to duplicates only if every threat is already claimed.

---

## [5.67.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Rail Driver fires a double-helix pair.** Each shot is now two bullets that spiral around a shared rail axis with opposite phase, crossing over each other every half period. The pair shares the rail's damage / range / piercing — the lateral oscillation is purely a visual signature, but the bullets cover a wider effective hit corridor as they wind. MULTI_SHOT now adds extra helix pairs (still narrowly fanned).
- **Rail Driver icon** swapped to 🧬 (DNA double helix) to match the new shot pattern.

### Internal
- Generic helix support added to the player `Bullet` entity (`helixActive`, `helixAmplitude`, `helixFreq`, `helixPhase`). The update step applies the *delta* of `sin(life·freq + phase)` perpendicular to `vel` each frame, so the underlying rail position still advances by `vel` exactly — collision math sees the displayed (helical) position. Reset to `false` in `Bullet.reset()` so non-helix shots from a recycled bullet aren't tainted.

---

## [5.66.1] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Radial-menu type label abbreviated.** `PRIMARY WEAPON` → `PRM`, `POWER WEAPON` → `PWR`, `DEFENSE SKILL` → `SKILL`. Frees up the center-hub real-estate so the hovered option name is the dominant text.
- **Rail Driver icon swapped** from ⚡ (which clashed with Lightning Arc, now also a primary) to 🛤️ — railway tracks read as "rail" at a glance.

---

## [5.66.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Lightning Arc moved from power weapon to primary weapon.** It now fires from left-click as a continuous lightning tether (same behavior as Lance Beam) and lives in the E radial menu instead of the R radial menu. Power-weapon roster drops to 4 (Charge Shot / Mine Layer / Nova Blast / Missile Salvo); primary roster grows to 6.
- **Lance Beam DPS dropped to match the projectile primaries.** Per-frame nibble damage 0.06 → 0.034 (60Hz × 0.034 ≈ 2.04 DPS), landing in the same bracket as Pulse Cannon (2.0), Storm Needles (2.31), and Rail Driver (2.5). Previously Lance Beam was the runaway DPS leader at 3.6.
- **Lightning Arc DPS now matches Lance Beam** at the same 0.034 per-frame nibble (~2.04 DPS at 60Hz).

### Removed
- The CONDUCTOR / STATIC_FIELD / TESLA_COIL upgrades (chain-pipeline-only) — they were already no-ops after the 5.64.15 continuous-tether rewrite. AMPLIFIER (per-frame damage scaling) survives and moves to PRIMARY_UPGRADES alongside the move.

---

## [5.65.3] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Radial menu slices show only the icon now.** The hovered option's name moved into the center hub and word-wraps onto multiple pixel-font lines if it doesn't fit on one. Slices stay readable at any number of options without competing with per-slice text.

---

## [5.65.2] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Radial menu pixel font swapped to Silkscreen.** Same 14px size and black-outline stroke; the smaller Silkscreen face packs longer weapon names into a slice without truncation while keeping the pixel aesthetic.

---

## [5.65.1] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Radial menu typography.** All radial-menu text (slice names, type label, hover label) now renders in 14px Press Start 2P with a 3px black outline stroke, matching the rest of the in-game pixel-font HUD. Improves legibility on top of the dim backdrop.

---

## [5.65.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Radial weapon/skill menus.** Holding **E**, **R**, or **F** opens a radial menu in the center of the screen and pauses gameplay. The menu shows every primary weapon (E), power weapon (R), or defense skill (F) as a pie slice with the option's icon and name. Aim with the mouse cursor to highlight a slice, left-click to equip, or release the key to dismiss without changing the equipped item. Replaces the old single-press cycle behavior on the same keys — you now see all options at once instead of stepping through them one at a time.

### Internal
- New module `js/modules/ui/radial-menu.js` owns the menu state, hover hit-testing, draw, and commit/cancel logic. Wired into `game-engine.js` (gates the update loop and renders the overlay), `event-setup.js` (E/R/F keydown opens, keyup cancels, mousedown commits), and `input-handler.js` (suppresses primary fire while a radial is open).

---

## [5.64.18] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Inverse-size brightness rule for WebGL stars** (the "astronomical" rule). Previously every WebGL star ran at full base alpha (`1.0`); the big color-star shapes consequently dominated the field and read as game entities. New rule:
  - **Tiny stars (≤ 2px)**: `alpha = 1.0` — punchy distant pinpoints.
  - **Mid stars (~6px)**: `alpha ≈ 0.85`.
  - **Big stars (~12px)**: `alpha ≈ 0.55`.
  - **Largest shape stars (~20+ px)**: `alpha ≈ 0.30` (clamped floor).
  - Curve: `1.0 - 0.8 × clamp((size - 2) / 28)`, floored at `0.20`.
  - **Mental model**: small bright dots = far away (high apparent surface brightness); big stars = closer with light spread out, atmospheric backdrop.
- **Color-star shape size bump tightened** `2.2× → 1.5×`. The largest shape silhouettes were dominating the field. Combined with the alpha-damp rule above they now feel atmospheric instead of game-relevant.
- **Pre-blend brightness gain in fragment shaders.** Using `clamp(tex.rgb × color.rgb × GAIN, 0, 1)` before output saturates hot pixels (white core pegs to 1.0) while letting dim halo pixels read proportionally brighter — emulates a screen-blend over-exposure feel with the existing additive blend mode (no need for an HDR float framebuffer).
  - Starfield: `BRIGHTNESS_GAIN = 1.6`.
  - Particles: `BRIGHTNESS_GAIN = 1.3`.

---

## [5.64.17] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **WebGL stars are brighter and more dynamic.**
  - Atlas dot widened (Gaussian coefficient `22 → 12`) and given a stronger halo (`0.5 × (1-r)^2.6 → 0.7 × (1-r)^2.0`); core occupies ~2× the pixel area.
  - Background star base alpha `0.7..1.0 depth-scaled → 1.0 flat`. Twinkle drives variation; baseline is full bright.
  - Background star quad size bumped `1.0× → 1.4×`.
  - Color star shape silhouettes (diamond/triangle/hexagon/star4-8) bumped `1.0× → 2.2×` so the silhouette is actually readable at typical depths. Dot stars match background bump.
  - Twinkle amplitude `0.15 → 0.35` (background) and `0.20 → 0.40` (color) — visible breathing.
  - **Size pulse**: vertex shader scales the quad by `0.94 + 0.18 × wave` in lockstep with the twinkle alpha. Stars literally breathe in and out.
  - **Hot-white peak shift**: vertex shader blends per-instance color toward white by 25% at the twinkle peak. Peak frames feel like a "hot flash" instead of just a brightness ramp.

- **Particle effects brightened.**
  - Particle atlas dot core widened (Gaussian coefficient `28 → 16`); halo amplitude `0.42 → 0.65` with shallower falloff (`(1-r)^3.0 → (1-r)^2.4`). Embers and small explosion fragments now read as proper hot motes.
  - `explosionEmber` alpha curve `pow(life, 0.55) → pow(life, 0.45)` — stays punchier through the mid-life. Quad `1.55× → 1.8×`.
  - `explosion` size `2.6× → 3.2×`, alpha multiplier `1.0 → 1.3`.
  - `starSparkle` size `7× → 8×`, alpha multiplier `2.5 → 3.0`.
  - `explosionFlash` alpha multiplier `0.6 → 0.95` — flash punch was being dampened unnecessarily. Quad `2.2× → 2.6×`.
  - `explosionRingColored` alpha multiplier `1.5 → 2.0`.

---

## [5.64.16] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **WebGL starfield layer.** New `WebGLStarfieldRenderer` + `webgl-starfield-atlas.js` render the bulk of the starfield (background stars + simple-shape decorative color stars) via a single instanced draw call on the existing `glCanvas`. Twinkle, parallax, and rotation all happen in the vertex shader — per-star CPU cost is essentially zero.
  - **Atlas**: 1024×128 with 8 shape slots (dot, diamond, triangle, hexagon, star4, star5, star6, star8).
  - **Per-instance attributes (14 floats)**: base position, parallax factor, size, RGBA color, twinkle phase / speed / amplitude, shape slot, base angle, rotation rate.
  - **Vertex shader**: `pos = mod(basePos - drift × parallax, fieldSize)` for parallax+wrap; `angle = baseAngle + time × rotRate` for rotation; `alpha *= (1-amp) + amp × (0.5 + 0.5 sin(time × speed + phase))` for twinkle.
  - **Single context**: shares the WebGL2 context with `WebGLParticleRenderer` (same `glCanvas`); starfield draws first each frame, particles draw on top.
- **Star-count bumps when WebGL is active.** `BACKGROUND_STAR_COUNT × 6` and `COLOR_STAR_COUNT × 3` (configurable via `WEBGL_BACKGROUND_STAR_MULTIPLIER` / `WEBGL_COLOR_STAR_MULTIPLIER` in `core/constants.js`). Default total: ~435 stars on WebGL vs ~10 stars left on Canvas2D.
- **`WEBGL_STARFIELD_KEEP_CANVAS_FALLBACKS`** toggle in `core/constants.js`. Default `true` — keeps Canvas2D drawing the complex shapes WebGL doesn't handle (sparkle/burst stars, collectible orbs). Flip to `false` to disable Canvas star drawing entirely for pure WebGL performance, at the cost of losing those animated silhouettes.

### Changed
- **Per-frame GL clear ownership moved to the engine.** `WebGLParticleRenderer.drawParticles` no longer clears the layer (would have wiped the starfield). Engine clears `glCanvas` once per frame before any GL renderer draws.
- **Canvas2D depth-batch renderer now skips stars whose `_inWebGL` flag is set.** When a star is added to the WebGL renderer at population time, it's flagged so the Canvas pass doesn't double-draw it.

---

## [5.64.15] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Beam-weapon category.** Lance Beam (primary) and Lightning Arc (power) are both now continuous-tether weapons that stop at the first object they hit. While the corresponding fire button is held, the beam is on; release to turn off.
  - **Lance Beam (LMB)**: discrete fire-rate / 2-second-duration cooldown is gone. The beam is on continuously while LMB is held. Each frame it picks the closest entity along the ray (smallest `proj`) within the beam-strip width and damages only that one. The renderer reads `p.beamHitDist` and clamps the visible beam length to the impact point — no more pierce.
  - **Lightning Arc (Space / RMB)**: 6-second cooldown gone. While held, the arc continuously targets the nearest enemy or asteroid within `chainRange` (no chain — single-target only) and applies `chainDamage` per frame as a nibble. Renderer draws a jagged-zigzag arc from player → target plus a bright inner core. Legacy chain-cast pipeline preserved as a no-op fallback for any old code paths.
- **Tutorial hints now re-show on every wave-1 start** (`{ once: false }`). Persistence was masking them for players who had already seen earlier versions. IDs bumped to v5/v4 to keep the localStorage keyspace clean.

### Removed
- The `beamTimer` countdown gate on Lance Beam in `player.update()`. Beam state is set directly from `input.fire` each frame in `weapons.js` now.

### Internal
- New player fields: `beamHitDist` (clamps Lance Beam render length), `lightningArcActive` + `lightningArcTarget` (continuous-tether state).

---

## [5.64.14] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **New keybind layout.**
  - **SPACE** — fire / charge POWER weapon (was: skill activate). Held to charge, released to fire. Mirrors right-click as a continuous trigger.
  - **TAB** — activate equipped DEFENSE skill (was: cycle primary). Browser-default focus advance is `preventDefault`'d.
  - **E** — cycle PRIMARY weapon (was: drop powerup cheat under SHIFT+E).
  - **R** — cycle POWER weapon (unchanged).
  - **F** — cycle DEFENSE skill (was: SHIFT-tap).
  - **SHIFT** is now FREE — no longer interpreted by the input handler.
  - Right-click stays as an alternate POWER-weapon trigger.
- **Tutorial hint IDs bumped to v4** so the new layout re-shows for players who dismissed earlier versions. New 12s hint ("hold Space or right-click for power, Tab for skill") replaces the old "tap Shift / press Space" copy.
- **Pause-menu CONTROLS tab** rewritten to list the new bindings explicitly (Space/Tab/E/R/F) instead of the abbreviated mouse-only summary.
- **README controls section** updated with the new layout.

### Removed
- **SHIFT-tap-to-cycle-skill bookkeeping** in `input-handler.js`. The press-timestamp + "did another key fire while shift was held" gates are gone — SHIFT is plain again.
- **`input.cycleSkill` flag.** The F key cycles directly via `event-setup.js` calling `player.cycleSkill()`; no input-flag pulse needed.

---

## [5.64.13] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **SKILL HUD square moved into the same row as PRM and PWR.** Layout is now `[PRM][PWR][SKILL]` in a single horizontal strip, with the same 12px horizontal `gap` between each square. `skillRowY = groupY` (same Y as PRM/PWR), `skillCx = groupX + 2 × (squareSize + gap) + squareSize / 2`.

---

## [5.64.12] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **SKILL HUD square repositioned.** Left-aligned with the PRM weapon square (`skillCx = groupX + squareSize / 2`) instead of centered between PRM and PWR. Vertical spacing above the SKILL square now matches the gap above the PRM/PWR row (10px from the bottom of the row above): `skillRowY = groupY + squareSize + 26`. Math: PRM label baseline sits 14px below the square; 9px glyphs extend ~2px below baseline → label bottom at `squareBottom + 16` → SKILL top at `squareBottom + 26` for a clean 10px clearance.

---

## [5.64.11] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Single-equipped defense skill model.** Replaces the 4-slot system bound to keys 1-4. The player has ONE equipped skill at a time. **Tap SHIFT** to cycle through all skills (parallels Tab/R for primary/power); **press SPACE** to activate the equipped skill.
- **Skill HUD square.** New square BELOW the PRM/PWR pair on the top-left HUD, labeled "SKILL". Shows the equipped skill's icon in its color, with cooldown overlay (proportional dark fill from bottom up + remaining seconds) and active-effect ring while the skill is firing.
- **Pause-menu SKILLS tab restyled.** Same click-to-equip format as the PRIMARY and POWER tabs. All 6 skills are listed; click any row to equip it. Replaces the old slot-assignment UI.
- **Quick cheat keys: `[` → +1000 Gold, `]` → +5 SP.** Solo-key shortcuts that don't require Shift. Show a brief CHEAT toast.
- **Tutorial hints for cycling skills.** New `wave1-cycle-skills-v1` hint fires 11s into wave 1 explaining SHIFT (cycle) + SPACE (activate). The existing weapon-cycle hint id was bumped (`v2 → v3`) so it re-fires for players who already dismissed the previous version.

### Changed
- **All skills are FREE.** Same model as primaries / powers — every skill is selectable from the start via the pause-menu SKILLS tab. Shop SKILLS-tab purchases now equip-for-free instead of charging SP.
- **SPACE no longer fires the power weapon.** Power weapon is right-click only. SPACE is reserved for skill activation.
- **Cheat console banner reduced.** The SHIFT-letter cheat list is gone; banner now shows the bracket cheats and a pointer to console-driven dev cheats (`window.gameEngine.cheats.*`).

### Removed
- **All SHIFT+ cheat codes.** They didn't fire reliably (SHIFT is now the skill-cycle key, so shift+letter combos partially conflict with the input handler's tap-to-cycle bookkeeping). The bracket cheats above are the supported quick-test path.
- **`Player.skillSlots[4]` and `Player.skillCooldowns[4]`.** Replaced by `Player.activeSkill` (string id) and `Player.activeSkillCooldown` (single number).
- **`Player.buySkill` / `Player.assignSkillToSlot`.** Replaced by `Player.equipSkill(id)` and `Player.cycleSkill()`.
- **Digit1-4 → skill1-4 input bindings.** Number keys 1-4 are now free for future use.
- **Old 4-slot bottom-center skill bar** in the HUD.

### Fixed
- Tutorial hints now actually surface (bumped IDs forced re-show for players who dismissed earlier versions). Stagger adjusted: 4s / 11s / 19s into wave 1.

---

## [5.64.10] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Sell button moved left of the cost / level display.** Inside the `.shop-item-right` flex wrapper the sell button is now appended FIRST and `costCol` second, so the red CTA reads first as the eye scans rightward and the price/level summary anchors the row's right edge.

### Added
- **Red "Level 0" tag for unpurchased upgrades.** New `.shop-item-status--zero` class colors the level tag `#ff6666` when `currentStacks === 0`, so the player can tell at a glance which upgrades they haven't put any stacks into yet.

---

## [5.64.9] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Sell button background was clipped to ~56px wide** (cutting off most of the "SELL +###" label). Root cause: `.shop-item` is a 3-column grid (`grid-template-columns: 56px 1fr auto`) and the sell button was being appended as the row's 4th child. CSS Grid auto-placed it into column 1 of an implicit second row — clamped to the icon column's 56px width, which clipped the red background to less than the SELL text. Fixed by wrapping `costCol` and `sellBtn` in a new `.shop-item-right` flex container that occupies the rightmost auto-sized grid column. The auto column now expands to fit cost + sell side-by-side, and the sell button's background spans the entire `SELL +1500SP` label.

---

## [5.64.8] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Damage number rendered twice on player hits.** Two parallel damage-number systems were both firing on every player hit:
  1. `createDamageNumber(...)` (the modern path) — pushes onto `this.damageNumbers` and renders via `hud/combat.js drawDamageNumbers` with crit, isPlayerHit, and isEmpowered styling.
  2. `particlePool.get(player.x, player.y, 'damageNumber', ...)` (the old path) — spawns a `Particle` of type `'damageNumber'` and renders via `Particle.draw()`'s switch case.
  Removed the three particle-pool spawn sites in `collision-system.js` (player hit by enemy / enemy bullet / asteroid). The `'damageNumber'` reset/update/draw branches in `particle.js` and the `DAMAGE_NUMBER_FONT` constant are also gone — dead code.

---

## [5.64.7] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Enemy explosions now play in two clearly-delineated beats: BIG RING first, debris second.**
  - **Beat 1 (frame 0)** — `triggerEnemyFinalExplosion` now fires synchronously on impact instead of waiting until the death-window midpoint. Bright flash + 3 expanding wavefront rings + the entire screen punch (hitstop, screen flash, camera kick, screen shake). Ship vanishes immediately. Ring sizes bumped back up since they no longer compete with debris in the same frame: `0.55/0.75/0.9 → 1.4/1.9/2.5` (largest is ~2.5× the enemy radius — substantial wavefront).
  - **Beat 2 (frame 6, ≈100ms later)** — new `triggerEnemyDebrisBurst` fires from the enemy update loop. Dense shrapnel streaks (36+) + classic dust (24) + the ship's own outline pieces ripping outward via `createShapeDebris`, plus a tight 0.6× secondary ring chasing the wreckage out. Debris emerges through the still-expanding rings (which have reached ~12% of their max radius by this frame), so the wavefront edge is visibly defined when the wreckage starts flying.
- **Impact frame is now particle-free.** No more flash / small ring / shrapnel / shape debris on tick 0 — those used to mush in front of the main bang. The kill juice (hitstop, kick, shake, flash) now lives entirely inside the big-ring announce so the screen only punches once, on the actual explosion frame.
- New `triggerEnemyDebrisBurst` exported from `combat-manager.js` and wired through `game-engine.js`.

### Fixed
- Death-sequence flag `_debrisBurstFired` initialized in the enemy constructor and reset on every spawn so a recycled pool slot doesn't skip the debris beat.

---

## [5.64.6] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Enemy big-bang rings cut hard.** The 5.64.5 reduction (2.0/2.7/2.2/3.2 → 1.2/1.6/1.3/1.9) wasn't enough — rings still washed out the ship-shred + shrapnel. New values:
  - **Big-bang final explosion**: dropped from 4 rings to 3, multipliers `1.2/1.6/1.3/1.9 → 0.55/0.75/0.9`. The 1.9× ring (the worst offender) is gone entirely; the largest remaining ring is now slightly smaller than the enemy ship itself.
  - **Initial impact**: `1.3/0.9 → 0.7/0.5`.
  - **Secondary outward ring**: `1.0 → 0.5`.
- Net effect: rings now read as tight wavefronts around the impact point rather than a halo larger than the wreckage. The shred + shrapnel carries the explosion mass.

---

## [5.64.5] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Enemy ships now visibly tear apart on death.** `createShapeDebris` rewritten:
  - Each outline edge is **fragmented** into 2 half-segments before spawning, so a HUNTER goes from 6 pieces to ~12, a TITAN from 20 to ~40, etc.
  - Every fragment gets a high-velocity outward kick (radial speed 2.6× base × random 0.25-1.75 jitter) plus a tangential perpendicular component at ~25% of the radial speed, so pieces scatter chaotically instead of unraveling in a clean ring.
  - Rotation rate multiplied 2.4× — pieces visibly tumble.
  - Internal struts expanded per enemy type (HUNTER: +engine-block detail lines, GUARDIAN: +grid ribs, WASP: +wing detail, TITAN/TANGERINE: +deeper inner ring + 4 more spokes, STALKER: +arm-tip caps, default: +radial spokes).
- **Tighter enemy explosion rings.** Big-bang ring radius multipliers `2.0/2.7/2.2/3.2 → 1.2/1.6/1.3/1.9`. Initial-impact rings `2.2/1.4 → 1.3/0.9`. Secondary outward ring `1.8 → 1.0`. Rings no longer dominate the shrapnel + ship-shred signal — the actual blowup reads through.
- **`lineDebrisPool` 20 → 100.** Sized for the new 2× fragment count plus simultaneous deaths.
- **Hit/destruction effects redelineated** (5.64.4 wasn't enough — landed in this same version):
  - Asteroid hit: NO screen shake (was light shake).
  - Asteroid destruction: shake only — no screen flash (flash reserved for enemy kills).
  - Enemy hit: small screen shake (NEW).
  - Enemy destruction: flash + shake (unchanged).
- **Shop sell button refund is now full at-cost.** `Math.floor(cost × 0.5) → cost`. Players don't lose currency when selling, so the upgrade tree functions as a permanent collection that lets you experiment freely instead of a sunk cost. Both `shop-dom.js`, `shop-manager.js`, and `shop-renderer.js` updated in lockstep so displayed and actual refunds match.
- **Sell button restyled.** Padding `6px 10px → 9px 14px`, more opaque background (`0.7 → 0.92`), brighter border, subtle box-shadow for depth, hover lifts via `transform: translateY(-1px)`. The red background now pads evenly around the entire `SELL +### ` label.
- **Shop opens on a random non-HELP tab.** Lands on PRIMARY / POWER / DEFENSE / SKILLS at random instead of always HELP, so each shop visit surfaces a different category up-front. HELP is still reachable from the tab row.
- **DEFENSE / SKILLS tabs got header banners.** Mirrors the equipped-weapon banner above PRIMARY / POWER for visual consistency. DEFENSE shows a green 🛡️ "Defense" header; SKILLS shows a magenta ⚡ "Skills" header.

---

## [5.64.4] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Hit/destruction effects redelineated between enemies and asteroids.** Enemies now feel "alive", asteroids "inert":
  - Enemy hit: small screen shake (was: nothing). Communicates contact through camera feel.
  - Enemy destruction: screen flash + screen shake (unchanged).
  - Asteroid hit: NO screen shake (was: light shake). Hit feedback through cursor flash + shrapnel/sparkles only.
  - Asteroid destruction: screen shake only (was: shake + screen flash). Flash is now reserved for enemy kills.
- **Ember lifespan halved.** Initial life `1.0-1.8s → 0.6-1.0s`; decay rate `0.009/tick → 0.020/tick`. With both adjustments, embers visibly cool from spawn to extinguish in ~1-1.5s instead of ~3-6s. Frees pool slots for the next burst and matches the "spark cooling" read better than "lingering glow."
- **Particle sprites sharpened further.** Second pass on the WebGL atlas:
  - **Ember (`dot`)**: hot-core Gaussian coefficient `18 → 28` (tighter); halo amplitude `0.55 → 0.42`, exponent `2.4 → 3.0` (smaller, steeper falloff). Embers now read as discrete pin-sharp glowing motes.
  - **Flash**: hotter radial body (Gaussian coefficient `6 → 8`); 4-point cross spike amplitude `0.45 → 0.6` and sigma tightened (`0.0008 → 0.0005`) so the spike is pixel-sharp.
  - **Sparkle (`spark`)**: pixel-thinner cardinal arms (`σ²=0.0006 → 0.00035`) and diagonals (`σ²=0.0009 → 0.0006`); diagonal amplitude `0.35 → 0.5`; central glow Gaussian `25 → 32`. True 8-point twinkling-star silhouette.
  - **Streak**: head taper `u^2.4 → u^2.8`; hot-tip boost `0.35 → 0.55` (sharper leading pixel-line).

---

## [5.64.3] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Sharper, more defined WebGL particle sprites.** Rebuilt `js/modules/performance/webgl-particle-atlas.js` so each slot is rendered procedurally pixel-by-pixel from a custom alpha curve instead of a CSS radial gradient. Visual upgrades:
  - **Ember (`dot`)**: Gaussian hot-core (`exp(-r² × 18)`) plus a softer quadratic halo. The bright centre is concentrated in the inner ~15% rather than spread through the inner 70%, so embers read as discrete glowing points instead of soft fuzzy clouds. Per-instance quad size trimmed `(r+6)×1.8 → (r+4)×1.55` to match.
  - **Flash**: kept the cool-blue radial body but overlaid a thin 4-point cross spike that fades with radius. Adds visible "punch" to the destruction flash without dominating it. Slight peak-alpha boost (0.55 → 0.6) so the spike reads cleanly.
  - **Sparkle**: NEW dedicated `spark` atlas slot — a 4-point cross star (cardinal arms full intensity, diagonals at 35%) with a tight central glow. `starSparkle` now maps to this slot instead of sharing `dot`, so sparkles look like actual sparkles instead of small fuzzy dots.
  - **Streak**: steeper head taper (`u^1.7 → u^2.4`) plus a Gaussian hot-tip at u≈1. Streaks now have a defined leading edge that reads as fast directional motion.
  - **Ring**: tighter Gaussian annulus (σ=0.13) with a soft inner-edge cut at r<0.45 so the ring reads as a defined wavefront edge.
- **Atlas dimensions**: 1024×256 → 1280×256 (added one 256×256 slot for spark). VRAM cost: +256KB. Shader and renderer changes are minimal — the per-instance UV attribute already carried slot offset/scale, so adding a slot needed only a UV-table entry and a `TYPE_TO_SLOT` remap.

## [5.64.2] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **`MAX_PARTICLES` 600 → 2500.** The 5.64.0 WebGL particle layer renders the migrated types in one instanced draw call at ~50ns per particle, so the per-particle cost is essentially flat regardless of count. The old 600 cap was tuned for Canvas2D headroom (3-4 simultaneous big-bangs); the new cap supports 8+ simultaneous big-bangs alongside ambient bullet-hit activity with no measurable frame-time cost.
- QA pool-cap tests updated to assert against the new cap.

---

## [5.64.1] - 2026-05-04

### Removed
- **Lingering ember trails behind enemies during combat.** Every bullet-on-enemy hit was spawning 4 `explosionEmber` particles at the impact point, each with 1.0-1.8s lifetime. As an enemy moved and the player kept shooting it, those embers accumulated as a soft fading cloud along the enemy's path. The 5.64.0 WebGL atlas dot has a more uniform falloff than the previous Canvas2D `shadowBlur` glow, so the cloud read as a continuous soft haze rather than discrete fading specks — louder visual noise. Hit feedback is unchanged: shrapnel streaks (8) + sparkle motes (2) still fire on every hit. Same motion-only philosophy as 5.63.1's enemy-explosion cleanup.

---

## [5.64.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **WebGL particle layer (`#glCanvas`) underneath the Canvas2D layer.** Bright/glowing particle types now render via a single instanced WebGL2 draw call per frame instead of one Canvas2D draw call per particle. Migrated types: `explosionEmber`, `explosionFlash`, `explosion`, `starSparkle`, `explosionShrapnel`, `explosionRingColored`. Architecture:
  - `js/modules/performance/webgl-particle-renderer.js` — single instanced draw, per-particle attributes (position, size, color, atlas UV, rotation), additive blending replaces Canvas2D's per-particle `globalCompositeOperation = 'screen'`.
  - `js/modules/performance/webgl-particle-atlas.js` — 1024×256 RGBA atlas with four 256×256 slots: dot (ember/sparkle/classic), flash gradient, hollow ring, horizontal streak. Baked once at module load.
  - GLSL shaders inline (vertex + fragment) — vertex transforms a unit quad to world coordinates, applies camera offset and per-instance rotation; fragment samples the atlas and multiplies by per-instance color.
  - `webglcontextlost` / `webglcontextrestored` listeners rebuild the program/atlas/VBOs on context loss.
- **`#glCanvas` element in `index.html`**, sized to viewport via the engine's resize handler.

### Changed
- **`drawParticlesBatched` is now single-pass.** The old two-pass screen-blend path is gone — every particle that used `globalCompositeOperation = 'screen'` now renders through WebGL with native additive blending. `SCREEN_BLEND_TYPES` removed.
- **`gameCanvas` clears to TRANSPARENT each frame** (was opaque-black). The black void of the game now comes from `#glCanvas`'s CSS background; the particle layer shows through wherever the Canvas2D layer hasn't drawn anything.
- **CSS layering**: both canvases occupy the same fixed viewport position; `#glCanvas` at z-index 0 with `background: #000`, `#gameCanvas` at z-index 1 with `background: transparent`.

### Removed
- **`Particle.draw()` cases for the 6 migrated types.** The Canvas2D draw paths are replaced by the WebGL renderer.
- **`radialGradientSpriteCache`** — no remaining consumers after `explosionFlash` migrated to the WebGL atlas.

### Performance
- One WebGL draw call replaces up to ~600 per-particle Canvas2D draws per frame. Frees ~0.5-1.2ms/frame in dense scenes and removes the `MAX_PARTICLES` cap pressure that drove the eviction issues fixed in 5.63.0.

---

## [5.63.1] - 2026-05-04

### Removed
- **All lingering particles from enemy explosions.** Enemy deaths now spawn motion-only particles — flash, expanding rings, outflying shrapnel, fast-velocity classic dust, and shape debris. Removed:
  - Initial impact: embers (6-14) + sparkles (6).
  - Midway big-bang: core glow ember cluster (6 slow embers at center), lingering embers (22-34), sparkle dust (22), cookoff embers (8).
  - Net per-kill pool pressure: ~145 → ~70 particles. With the 600 cap, that's headroom for 8 simultaneous big-bangs to render fully alongside ambient activity, instead of 3-4.

### Changed
- Midway big-bang's classic small particles bumped speed range `2-11 → 3-12` so even the slow tail of the burst has visible outward motion. Count `36 → 24` since each remaining particle contributes more.
- Initial-impact shrapnel count and shape-debris emission unchanged — those were already pure motion.

---

## [5.63.0] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Enemy explosions are now actually consistent.** Root cause identified and removed: every big-bang scheduled FOUR `setTimeout`-deferred ring spawns at 60/130/220ms, plus a 100ms-deferred secondary cookoff. Those `.get()` calls fired AFTER ambient bullet/asteroid particle activity had refilled the pool — and the late spawns then evicted THIS explosion's earlier shrapnel/embers via the FIFO eviction policy. Result: every other kill looked weak because half its own particles were gone before the deferred rings even spawned. All deferred spawns now fire **instantly in the same frame** as the rest of the explosion. Visual cascade is preserved because each ring particle has its own `0.9s` lifetime and expansion curve — four rings at different `maxRadius` values still look like concentric wavefronts radiating out.

### Changed
- **MAX_PARTICLES 320 → 600** to give 3-4 simultaneous big-bangs full headroom alongside ambient activity. The 5.60.0 sprite-cache renderer makes the higher cap effectively free.
- **Cached `cos/sin` for `explosionShrapnel`.** Angle and speed don't change after init, so the draw path no longer recomputes `Math.cos(angle)` / `Math.sin(angle)` / `Math.hypot(vel)` every frame per particle. ~3 trig ops per particle per frame eliminated. With 30-50 active shrapnel during enemy deaths, a small but free win.

### Documentation
- **`docs/WebGL Migration Analysis – 2026-05-04.md`** — full audit of the rendering surfaces, where Canvas2D wins now, where WebGL would help, realistic 4-6 week migration cost, and a hybrid (WebGL particles + Canvas2D everything else) middle path. Recommendation: stay on Canvas2D for now; revisit if we ever need >2-3K simultaneous particles or hit a wall the existing optimizations can't clear.

---

## [5.62.2] - 2026-05-04

### Removed
- **Per-frame popcorn cookoffs during enemy death drift.** The 9 small bursts during the 36-frame drift phase were inconsistent — sometimes clipped by particle pool eviction, sometimes hidden by the silhouette glow, sometimes interrupted by the wave-clear → shop transition. Every enemy now gets a single guaranteed big explosion at the death midpoint instead of trying to fire popcorn through a busy pool. Less chance for things to be cut off.

### Changed
- **Death sequence simplified to two beats.**
  - Ticks 0-11: wreck drifts (silhouette visible, no popcorn). 200ms beat for the player to register the kill.
  - Tick 12: BIG midway explosion (`triggerEnemyFinalExplosion`), ship vanishes, full debris cloud. Always fires.
  - Ticks 13-23: debris drifts via its own particle physics.
  - Tick 24: recycle.
  Total death duration: 24 frames / 400ms (was 36 / 600ms). Snappier pacing, single guaranteed big explosion, perfectly consistent across HUNTER / WASP / GUARDIAN / etc.
- **Wave-clear gate now waits for ALL death animations to fully complete.** Previously the gate filtered out enemies with `_deathFlash > 0`, so it fired the moment the last enemy STARTED dying — the shop could then pop over an in-progress explosion. Now uses `enemyPool.activeObjects.length` directly. Mid-death enemies still have `active = true`, so they keep the gate closed until their `_deathFlash` reaches 0 and they recycle. The big-bang always finishes before "WAVE COMPLETE" appears.
- **WAVE COMPLETE message + fade window before the shop opens.** Was: 700ms after wave-clear → shop. Now: WAVE COMPLETE message at full opacity 0-1300ms, fade-out across last 35% (1300-2000ms), shop opens at 2000ms. Player gets a clear visual / temporal pause between gameplay and shop interaction. Message duration is hardcoded to 2000ms (was the 5000ms `waveCountdownDuration`) so the fade aligns with the shop trigger.

---

## [5.62.1] - 2026-05-04

### Removed
- **`explosionFlash` particle on non-lethal enemy hits** across all damage paths:
  - Bullet → enemy collision (`enemy.radius * 0.45` flash at impact point)
  - Lance Beam → enemy contact (35%-throttled `enemy.radius` flash)
  - Nova wavefront crossing each enemy (`size 22` flash)
  - Lightning chain target (`size 28` flash)
  Sparks, embers, and sparkles still fire on every hit so the contact reads — only the bright pop is gone. Flash is now reserved entirely for the destruction event (impact frame `0.06α` + midway big-bang `0.12α`), so the visual punch lands harder when an enemy actually dies.

---

## [5.62.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Animated health bar.** The bar's fill smoothly eases toward the player's current HP each frame instead of snapping. Drain (taking damage) eases at 16% / frame and gain (heal/respawn) at 30% / frame — asymmetric curve makes hits read as a clear chunk leaving the bar while heals snap back faster. HP text below the bar still shows the live integer value, so the bar provides drama and the text provides truth. **XP bar is untouched** — it still uses live values exactly as before.
- **Screen flash on enemy destruction (only) restored.** Re-added small `triggerScreenFlash(0.06, 4)` on the impact frame and a bigger `triggerScreenFlash(0.12, 6)` on the midway big-bang. Non-lethal hits still don't flash. Reserves the visual punch for actual destruction events.

### Changed
- **Popcorn cookoffs are now actually visible.** The death-flash silhouette's additive glow was 3.0× the enemy radius — popcorn bursts spawning at 0.3-1.1× radius were drowning under the halo. Two changes:
  - Silhouette glow radius cut from 3.0× → 1.5× the enemy radius.
  - Popcorn now spawns at 1.4-2.2× radius (outside the halo) with bigger flashes (`r × 1.3` instead of `r × 0.85`) and bigger rings (`r × 1.6-2.4` instead of `r × 0.8-1.7`).
- **Popcorn particle count cut ~50% per burst, but each one is bigger and brighter.** From ~12 particles per burst down to 6: 1 flash + 1 ring + 3 sparks + 1 ember (was 1 flash + 2 rings + 5 sparks + 2 embers + 2 sparkles). Sparkles dropped — too small to read at gameplay scale. Total popcorn-phase particles drop from ~108 → ~54 across the 9 bursts before the midway big bang.
- **Consistent visibility across enemy colors.** Popcorn rings now alternate white / enemy color (was random per-burst), and shrapnel always leads with a white spark. So a HUNTER's red explosion reads with the same intensity as a WASP's yellow one — no more "red ships have worse explosions" because the bright reference particles are always present.

---

## [5.61.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Background star count halved across the board.** Multiplier on `BACKGROUND_STAR_COUNT` cut from `4×` → `2×` (also in pool-init pre-allocation). Total background stars drop from 120 → 60. Parallax depth from the depth-bucket batched renderer carries the visual richness — 60 stars feel as full as 120 used to. Free perf for every frame in every wave.
- **Particle render is now two-pass batched by composite mode.** New `drawParticlesBatched(pool, ctx, ...)` helper (in `world/particle.js`) splits the pool into source-over particles (drawn first) and screen-blend particles (drawn second with composite set ONCE). Replaces the old per-particle composite toggle: in dense scenes with 100+ screen-blend particles, that's 200 `globalCompositeOperation` writes per frame collapsing to 2. `Particle.draw` for `explosionFlash`/`explosionEmber` no longer touches composite — the batched caller manages it. Game-engine render path now uses the batched function.
- **Late-wave AI throttle (waves 15+).** Each enemy's heavy spatial scans (`avoidAsteroids`, `maintainDistanceFromEnemies`, `dodgeEnemyBullets`, `dodgePlayerBullets`, `updateEvasiveManeuvers`, `maintainDistanceFromPlayer`, `patrolTerritory`) now run on alternating frames, staggered per-enemy via a random `_aiOffset` set at spawn. Half the enemies tick AI on even frames, half on odd. Movement, facing, and shooting still update every frame so the action stays smooth. Cuts AI cost ~50% in waves 15-20.
- **Asteroid projection stagger.** `_projectionDirty` is now flipped every-other-frame per asteroid (random `_projOffset` per spawn), so only half the field re-projects 3D vertices each frame. Rotations still advance every frame; the projected vertices just lag by at most one frame (16ms at 60fps — imperceptible for tumbling rocks). Warping asteroids force-project every frame so the warp-in animation stays crisp.
- **`frameClock.tick` is now an integer counter** (was the function name). Renamed the function to `frameClock.advance()`. Used by the new AI throttle and asteroid stagger to do cheap parity checks. Single call site (`game-engine.gameLoop`) updated.

### Notes
- Combined with the 5.60.0 sprite-baking pass, particle render cost should be down ~60% from pre-perf-plan baseline. Sustained 60fps in late-wave dense scenes is now the target.
- Items still on the perf plan: spatial-grid bullet dodge, adaptive particle quality (fail-safe), classic-for-loop conversions for the dodge functions. Most-impactful wins are landed.

---

## [5.60.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Pre-baked glow sprites for the two hottest particle types — major particle render speedup.** This is item #1 from `docs/Performance Optimization Plan – 2026-05-03.md`.
  - **`explosionFlash`**: was building a fresh 4-stop radial gradient on every draw call (`createRadialGradient` is one of the heaviest Canvas2D ops, ~0.05ms each), then `arc + fill`. New `radialGradientSpriteCache` bakes the 128×128 multi-stop sprite ONCE at module load and reuses it via `drawImage` — single GPU bitblt per particle. With ~30-50 concurrent flashes during a mine explosion or enemy death cluster, this saves multiple milliseconds per frame.
  - **`explosionEmber`**: was doing two `arc + fill` passes (body + halo) with a `globalCompositeOperation` toggle in between. Now uses the existing `glowSpriteCache.draw()` (per-color cached sprite with shadowBlur baked in) — single `drawImage`. Eliminates the second arc/fill entirely. Embers are the most numerous particle in the game (~24 per enemy death + 6-12 per popcorn burst), so this scales well.
- **Particle pool now has the headroom to actually USE 320 active particles** without the framerate caving — the bottleneck wasn't the count, it was the per-particle render cost. Should make late-wave dense scenes (boss + 5 enemies dying simultaneously) hold solid 60fps.

### Notes
- The flash sprite uses the same color stops as before — bakes pure white at 0.85α tapering through blue-white to transparent, so the on-screen look is preserved.
- Ember sprite uses the existing `glowSpriteCache` shadowBlur recipe (blur=8). The visual is slightly softer than the old hand-drawn body+halo combo (one larger soft glow vs separate body+halo), but reads identically at gameplay scale.
- Future wins from the perf plan still on the table: sort particles by composite mode (eliminates per-frame `globalCompositeOperation` toggles), throttle late-wave enemy AI to 30Hz, asteroid projection skip on small angle deltas. See `docs/Performance Optimization Plan – 2026-05-03.md` for the full priority list.

---

## [5.59.4] - 2026-05-03

### Removed
- **Fullscreen screen flash on enemy damage / death.** Both `triggerScreenFlash` calls in the enemy death pipeline are gone — the impact-frame `0.10` and the midway-explosion `0.16`. Stacked enemy kills used to wash the screen white. Hitstop, camera kick, and screen shake still carry the impact, and the localized particle flashes do the visual work without globally tinting the canvas.

### Changed
- **Particle pool cap raised 220 → 320** for consistency. The 36-frame multi-stage enemy death sequence (impact + 9 popcorn bursts + midway big-bang + lingering debris) emits ~230 particles concurrently. With the old 220 cap, ambient bullets/asteroid hits could evict the death sequence's own particles mid-flight, making enemy explosions look weak or missing parts. The 320 cap gives the full sequence room to breathe alongside ~90 particles of ambient activity. QA tests updated to spawn 500-600 and assert `≤ 330`.

---

## [5.59.3] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Enemy death sequence reorganized — big bang at the midpoint, ship vanishes, debris keeps flying.**
  - **Popcorn now starts immediately**, every **2 frames** (was every 3, gated until after impact). The wreck is constantly cooking off from frame 1 onwards.
  - **Big final explosion now fires at the midpoint** (frame 18 of a 36-frame death window) instead of at the end. Triggered exactly once via a new `_shipDestroyed` flag.
  - **Ship suddenly disappears** the moment the big explosion fires — `enemy.draw` early-returns when `_shipDestroyed`, so the silhouette is gone and only the debris cloud remains.
  - **Popcorn stops** once the ship vanishes (gated on `!_shipDestroyed`) — it was the ship cooking off, so once the ship's gone, no more cooking. Existing debris drifts under its own particle physics for the remaining ~18 frames before recycle.
  - **Bumped final-explosion debris counts** so the midway pop reads as the ship physically breaking apart:
    - Shrapnel `22-34 → 36-54` pieces, speed range `5-14 → 6-18`.
    - Lingering embers `14-22 → 22-34`.
    - Classic small particles `22 → 36`, speed range `2-9 → 2-11`.
    - Sparkle dust `14 → 22`, spread `1.4× → 1.8×` radius.
    - **Shape debris fires a second time** at the big bang (in addition to the impact-frame scatter) so a fresh batch of outline pieces flies out alongside the ship vanishing.
  - `_deathFlash` and `_shipDestroyed` reset at every spawn so a recycled pool slot doesn't start out destroyed.

---

## [5.59.2] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Enemy explosions are significantly more epic.** Enemies are a big deal — the player should feel every kill from impact through finale.
  - **Phase A (initial impact)** now triggers a real screen shake (14 frames @ 7 magnitude, scaled by radius), bumped hitstop 5 → 6 frames, screen flash 0.07 → 0.10, and camera kick 14 → 18.
  - **Phase B (drift popcorn)** fires every **3** frames instead of 5 (≈12 popcorn bursts across the 36-frame death window, was ≈7). Each burst now spawns:
    - 2 expanding rings (was 1) — bright core + colored halo
    - 5 directional sparks (was 3)
    - 2 embers (was 1) + 2 sparkle motes (was 1)
    - **A small screen shake** (4 frames, magnitude 2-4.5 tapering with the wreck's remaining life) so the player feels every secondary cookoff
  - **Phase C (final explosion)** got the biggest punch in the sequence: hitstop 4 → 7, screen flash 0.10 → 0.16, camera kick 11 → 18, screen shake **28/14 → 38/22** (frames/magnitude) with magnitude scaled at 3.0× radius (was 2.4×). The finale is unmistakable.

---

## [5.59.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **`ReferenceError: i is not defined` on every enemy explosion** that crashed the game loop. The popcorn-burst code in `enemy.update`'s death-flash branch (added in 5.59.0) referenced the for-loop counter `i` after the loop body ended — `i` is `let`-scoped and wasn't visible at the ember-spawn line. Replaced with `tickIntoDeath % 2` so the ember color still alternates without leaning on the dead loop variable.

---

## [5.59.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Multi-stage epic enemy death sequence.** Replaces the single-burst `createEnemyDebris` pop with a three-phase death:
  - **Phase A — initial impact** (frame 0): bright flash + 2 expanding rings (white + enemy color), 10-22 directional shrapnel, 6-14 embers, 6 sparkle motes, shape debris, hitstop + screen flash + camera kick. Screen shake is held back for the finale.
  - **Phase B — drift + popcorn** (frames 1-35, ≈600ms): the wreck keeps drifting under inertia (friction 0.97/frame, faceAngle wobble +0.04/frame). Every 5 frames a small popcorn burst spawns at a random offset around the body — flash + colored ring + 3 sparks + ember + sparkle. Reads as "the wreck is breaking apart as it tumbles."
  - **Phase C — final explosion** (frame 36, just before recycle): big core flash (×2.4 radius), four staggered rings spaced 0/60/130/220ms, 22-34 directional shrapnel in a 4-color rotation (white/gold/enemy color/orange), 6-element core glow cluster, 14-22 lingering embers, 22 classic small particles, 14 sparkles, screen flash + camera kick + screen shake (28 frames @ 14 mag), plus a 100ms-delayed cookoff with 8 scattered embers + a final ring. Position is captured at function entry so pool recycling can never desync the spawn coords.
  - Death-flash duration extended from 8 frames → 36 (~600ms) to give the drift phase room to read.
- **Explosions are now guaranteed.** The final explosion fires from inside the enemy's update branch the tick `_deathFlash` hits 0 — same code path as the active-flag flip, so there's no way the enemy can deactivate without explode-trigger running. Wrapped in try/catch and `typeof === 'function'` gates so a transient missing engine ref can't silently swallow it.

---

## [5.58.1] - 2026-05-03

### Removed
- **Free health top-up between waves.** `startNextWave` no longer sets `player.health = getEffectiveMaxHealth()`. The player keeps whatever HP they finished the wave with — health orbs, MEDPACK pickups, and the shop are the only legitimate heals now. Current health is still clamped to the live max in case a Health Boost stack purchased between waves changed the cap.

---

## [5.58.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Damage numbers when the player gets hit.** All four player-damage paths (player↔enemy collision, player↔asteroid collision, enemy bullet hit, generic `lifecycle.takeDamage`) now spawn a damage number above the player. Renders red and bold with a leading "−" prefix (e.g. `−12`) so it's instantly distinguishable from the gold enemy/asteroid hit numbers. New `isPlayerHit` opt on `createDamageNumber` drives the styling in `hud/combat.js drawDamageNumbers`.
- **Epic player-hit FX** — every player damage event now fires a unified `triggerPlayerHitFX(impactX, impactY, damage)` helper:
  - Bright red-tinted impact flash + 90-150 px shockwave ring at the player.
  - 12-28 directional shrapnel pieces in a white/red/orange/crimson rotation.
  - 6-14 lingering embers + 8-16 sparkle motes scattered around.
  - Screen flash alpha 0.18 → 0.36 (scaled by damage), shake duration 16-30 frames at 6-15 magnitude, hitstop 3-7 frames.
  - Camera kicks AWAY from the impact point — direction computed from impact vector — so the world feels like it just got shoved.
  - All counts/intensities scale on a `severity = clamp(damage/25, 0.4, 1.0)` curve so a graze still reads while a 25-damage cataclysm shakes the screen apart.

### Changed
- `lifecycle.takeDamage` swapped its legacy `particlePool.get(..., 'damageNumber', ...)` call out for the proper `createDamageNumber` system — consistent rendering with all other damage numbers.

---

## [5.57.2] - 2026-05-03

### Removed
- **Reverted the asteroid wave-clear gate.** Wave now completes the moment all enemies are dead — the asteroid threshold + ENEMIES CLEARED pulse + asteroid-easy-mode HP halving all gone. The cleanup phase felt off in practice, and accumulating rocks across waves was tanking perf. Asteroids are back to "obstacles/loot you can ignore."

### Changed
- **Asteroid spawn counts trimmed across the roster** to compensate for asteroids bleeding forward into the next wave (no more clear-the-field gate to reset things):
  - Waves 1-4: 5/6/6/5 → 3/3/3/3
  - Waves 6-8: 4 each → 3 each
  - Wave 9: 3 → 2
  - Waves 11-13: 3 each → 2 each
  - Boss + late waves unchanged (already low).
  Wave 14+ counts were already at 2; carryover keeps the field meaningfully populated without overloading.

---

## [5.57.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Asteroid-vs-asteroid collision response is back — but no position correction.** Real impacts now bounce, while still-overlapping or already-separating pairs are left alone. The trick is gating the elastic-velocity-exchange on the relative-velocity-along-normal sign:
  - `(v2 − v1) · n̂ < 0` → pair is closing → swap normal velocity components, keep tangential. Real impact bounce.
  - `≥ 0` → already separating (or stationary-overlapping) → skip. Lets fragments from a split fly apart on their own velocity; lets stuck-overlapping rocks rest peacefully without jittering.
  No positional displacement is ever applied — the visible "shift/jump" that prompted disabling collisions in 5.54.6 stays gone. Light debris particles spawn on real impacts (2-3, on-screen only) so the bump reads.

---

## [5.57.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **"ENEMIES CLEARED" pulse** — the moment the last enemy of a wave dies, the player gets:
  - A green-tinted shockwave ring (radius 240) + bright flash + 18 directional sparks + 14 lingering embers anchored on the player's position.
  - A camera kick + screen shake + screen flash (alpha 0.18) for tactile feedback.
  - A "ENEMIES CLEARED — Mop up the rocks" toast at the top of the screen.
  - **Asteroid HP is halved across the entire field**, and any fragments spawned during the rest of the wave inherit halved HP too (`asteroidEasyMode` flag). The cleanup phase is breezy instead of grindy.
  Pulse fires exactly once per wave (`enemiesClearedThisWave` gates it). Both flags reset on the next `spawnWaveEntities`.

### Changed
- **Power-curve scaling formulas** — replaces the linear-per-level math so early waves are easy and late waves climb sharply.
  - **Enemy HP**: `1 + ((L-1)/19)^1.6 · 4.5`. L1: 1.0×, L5: 1.36× (was 1.72×), L10: 2.34× (was 2.62×), L15: 3.82×, L20: 5.50× (was 4.42×).
  - **Enemy points**: `1 + ((L-1)/19)^1.4 · 5.5`. L1: 1.0×, L5: 1.50× (was 2.0×), L20: 6.50× (was 5.75×).
  - **Enemy speed level**: `1 + ((L-1)/19)^1.4 · 0.7`. L1: 1.0×, L5: 1.06× (was 1.24×), L20: 1.70× (was 2.14×). Gentle on top of the campaign mult.
  - **Enemy speed campaign**: `0.55 + ((w-1)/19)^1.5 · 2.0`. W1: 0.55×, W5: 0.74× (was 1.03×), W10: 1.20× (was 1.63×), W15: 1.82×, W20: 2.55× (was 2.83×).
  - **Asteroid HP**: `1 + ((L-1)/9)^1.5 · 4.0`. L1: 1.0×, L3: 1.21× (was 1.56×), L5: 1.94× (was 2.12×), L10: 5.0× (was 3.52×).
  Net effect: waves 1-5 feel meaningfully easier than 5.56.x; waves 15-20 are roughly on-par or harder.
- **Asteroid fragmentation reduced from 3-4 → 2 pieces per split.** Stops the field from exponentially accumulating after a few large-asteroid kills, while still preserving the satisfying split feel.
- **Asteroid wave-clear threshold relaxed.** Was "live ≤ floor(start/2)" → now "live ≤ ceil(start · 0.40)". Some leftovers are intentional — they bleed into the next wave and make the late game feel chaotic.

### Removed
- The previous "must destroy half the asteroids" gate that contributed to the asteroid-accumulation problem. Replaced by the enemies-cleared-pulse + lenient threshold combo.

---

## [5.56.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Smallest health/money orbs now ~75% larger.** `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_MIN` 1.3 → 2.28, `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MIN` 1.3 → 2.28. Max sizes bumped proportionally (1.4 → 2.45 health, 1.6 → 2.55 money) so big drops still feel meaningfully larger than small ones. Tiny low-value orbs are now legible at a glance instead of vanishing into the asteroid debris.

### Documentation
- **README — full run instructions for every npm script.** Fleshed out the "Running Scripts & Services" section: dev/build, asset generators (`generate-playlist`, `generate-sfx`), all unit / QA / E2E / perf test variants, Allure reports, mitata microbenchmarks (with per-suite shortcuts), and the AI QA bot (`qa:bot:*` — quick / long / headed / bugs / balance / novice / report). Added infrastructure notes covering Playwright browser install, Allure bundling, Node version, and the shared `tests/helpers/game-ai.js` API.

---

## [5.56.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Wave-clear gate now requires destroying half the wave's asteroids** in addition to killing all enemies. The starting asteroid count is captured when the wave spawns; the player must reduce the live count to ≤ floor(start/2) before the wave will complete. Forces actual engagement with the asteroid field instead of dancing around it.
- **Performance optimization plan** authored at `docs/Performance Optimization Plan – 2026-05-03.md` — audits suspected bottlenecks (particle render, O(N²) AI loops, asteroid 3D projection per-frame, shadowBlur cost), proposes 7+ technical and 5+ gameplay optimizations, and prioritizes by estimated payoff.

### Changed
- **Steeper enemy/asteroid scaling** (second pass — the difficulty curve in 5.55.0 was still too gentle):
  - Enemy HP per level: +14% → +18% (wave 20 = 4.42× base, was 3.66×).
  - Enemy speed per level: +5% → +6%.
  - Enemy points per level: +20% → +25% (wave 20 = 5.75× base reward).
  - Campaign-wide speed multiplier: 0.60→2.50 → 0.55→2.83 across waves 1-20.
  - Asteroid HP per level: +23% → +28% (wave-20 rocks 3.52× base, was 3.07×).
- **Sell button stays on one line.** Added `white-space: nowrap`, `flex-shrink: 0`, and explicit `text-align: center` to `.shop-item-sell` so labels like `SELL +1500SP` no longer wrap onto two lines on narrower rows.

---

## [5.55.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Game-wide balance pass — rarer but more potent powerups, steeper enemy/asteroid scaling, smaller late-wave rosters.**
  - **Powerup drop rates cut ~65–70%.** Small asteroid 15% → 5%, large asteroid 20% → 8%, WASP 65% → 22%, TITAN 80% → 50%, TANGERINE 70% → 28%, default enemy 55% → 18%.
  - **Per-stack powerup effects bumped 25–50%** to compensate for the lower drop rate — every pickup now meaningfully changes the build:
    - RAPID_FIRE: −15% → −22% fire delay per stack (compounding)
    - BIG_BULLETS: +1.5px → +2.2px radius per stack
    - HOMING: 0.06 → 0.09 strength per stack (caps at 0.4)
    - SPEED_BOOST: +50% → +65% thrust per stack
    - LONG_RANGE: +40% → +55% range per stack
    - SHIELD_BOOST: +5% → +8% damage reduction per stack
    - HEALTH_BOOST: +25 → +35 max HP per stack (cap raised 525 → 600)
    - CRIT_CHANCE: +5% → +7% per stack (cap 50% → 60%)
    - CRIT_DAMAGE: +10% → +15% per stack (cap 500% → 550%)
    - KNOCKBACK: +30% → +40% per stack (cap 3.0× → 3.5×)
  - **Enemy scaling steepened** for the 20-wave campaign:
    - Per-level HP: +10% → +14% (wave 20 enemies have 3.66× base HP, was 2.9×)
    - Per-level speed: +4% → +5% (gentle scaling on top of campaign mult)
    - Per-level points: +15% → +20% (reward keeps up with risk)
    - Campaign-wide speed multiplier: 0.65→2.17 → 0.60→2.50 across waves 1–20
  - **Asteroid HP scaling steepened**: +18% → +23% per level (wave 20 rocks ~3.07× base HP, was 2.6×).
  - **Late-wave roster trimmed** so the steeper HP/speed scaling — not raw entity count — is what makes endgame hard, keeping perf solid:
    - Waves 6–9: asteroid count cut by 1, total enemy count down by ~1 per wave.
    - Waves 11–14: asteroid count cut by 1, enemy count cut by 1–2 per wave.
    - Waves 16–19: asteroid + enemy counts both cut. Wave 19 dropped from 9 enemies → 7.
    - Final boss (Wave 20): 4× TITAN + 2× GUARDIAN + 2× SENTINEL → 3× TITAN + 1× GUARDIAN + 2× SENTINEL.

---

## [5.54.7] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Enemies actively steer around asteroids.** The previously-disabled `avoidAsteroids` AI hook is re-enabled and tuned: detection threshold now factors in BOTH the enemy's and the asteroid's radii (plus a 70-px buffer) so a small enemy near a large rock starts dodging early; force scales inversely with distance (gentle at threshold, strong near impact); skips warping / death-flashing asteroids; capped at 1.7× the enemy's base speed so stacked pushes can't fling the enemy across the field. Bumped from 0.08 → 0.14 force for decisive clearing.
- The existing enemy-vs-asteroid collision handler already deals no damage to either party (the "No damage to enemy" / "No enemy destruction" path) — it only transfers momentum + rotation. Behavior preserved: enemies and asteroids can bump into each other without dealing damage; AI just tries hard not to.

---

## [5.54.6] - 2026-05-03

### Removed
- **Asteroid-vs-asteroid collision response.** The elastic-bounce + positional-overlap-displacement pass on every overlapping pair was producing visible shifts/jumps every frame two rocks touched (especially right after a split, where fragments would jam into each other). Asteroids now overlap freely. They still register all other collision paths intact: player, bullets, lance beam, mines, nova, lightning, missiles, enemies. Just no rock-on-rock pushing.

---

## [5.54.5] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Powerup pickup description now uses Press Start 2P (matching the name).** Same pixel font as the wavy title above it. 14px is the largest size that keeps the longer blurbs (~40 chars) on one line while still being chunky-pixel legible. Stroke 4 + shadowBlur 6 halo preserved for contrast on any background.

---

## [5.54.4] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Powerup pickup description is much more legible.** Bumped from 13px Silkscreen (nearly invisible against the busy starfield/effects) to 22px Arial. Stroke width 3 → 5, soft black `shadowBlur: 6` halo behind the stroke for additional contrast, and the descY offset bumped 28 → 38 to clear the larger title's wave amplitude.

---

## [5.54.3] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Powerup pickup descriptions actually surface now.** The 5.54.2 fix added descriptions to `getPowerupConfig`, but the actual pickup path uses `POWERUP_TYPES[type]` (which already had description fields). The real bug was the engine dispatcher: `showPowerupDisplay(name, color)` only forwarded TWO args, dropping the third `description` arg even though `combat.showPowerupDisplay` accepted it and the HUD render code consumed it. Engine method now forwards all three args.
- **Title-screen launch animations stay centered on the actual title.** Two issues compounded into a leftward bias on every animation:
  - `_measureLetterPositions` returned each letter's left-edge x; `_titleLetterDraw` then re-rendered a single-char `drawWavyText` whose internal `textAlign='center'` shifted it half-a-letter-width further left. Fix: helper now returns the letter's visual center (left edge + width/2) so the static and animated rendering perfectly overlap.
  - Wave / cascade / warpdrive used a hardcoded `baseSpacing = 70` and a `+6` rightward bias for layout, then scaled outward against `centerX` — but the actual title row sits at `centerX + 10` (an optical-alignment nudge in the static rendering), so the row's expansion was asymmetric. All three animations now read positions directly from the static-title `staticPositions` array and scale outward from the row's own midpoint (`(staticPositions[0].x + staticPositions[N-1].x) / 2`), so the row stays symmetric throughout the zoom.
  - Twister, explosion, and pinwheel all projected toward `(centerX, centerY)` instead of the title's actual center. They now project toward the title midpoint so the column / explosion / ring is anchored on the static title.
  - Explosion was using fully-random per-letter directions, which could cluster the burst toward one side. Now evenly distributes the N letters around the unit circle plus a small per-letter jitter so each launch still varies but the spread is balanced.

---

## [5.54.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Powerup pickup blurbs now actually show.** The HUD's `drawPowerupDisplay` was already wired to render `powerupDisplay.description` under the powerup name, and `collectPowerup` was already piping `powerup.config.description` into it — but the configs returned from `getPowerupConfig` had no `description` field, so the blurb was always empty. Added a one-line description for every powerup type (Shielding, Rapid Fire, Multi Shot, Afterburner, Big Bullets, Piercing, Explosive, Homing, Medpack, Health Boost, Triage, Critical Chance, Critical Damage, Long Range, Charge Speed, Charge Power, Health/Money Orb Luck/Bounty, Doctor, Payday, High Roller) plus a passthrough for weapon/skill upgrades that already carry `description` in weapon-data.js.

---

## [5.54.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Title-screen lens-flare nebula now also rotates with parallax.** `nebulaRenderer.draw()` takes an optional `rotation` (radians) plus `viewW/viewH` for the on-screen pivot, and rotates each layer about the viewport center scaled by `layer.depth` — so the closest layer (depth 0.65) rotates about 4.5× more than the deepest (depth 0.00), matching the parallax-drift depth feel rotationally as well as positionally. The title-screen update branch drives it with a slow combined-frequency oscillator (≈35s and ≈90s periods) summing to a ±0.19 rad swing, so the lens flare stars tumble gently without ever spinning fast enough to distract.

---

## [5.54.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Weapon effects across the board are now significantly more epic.**
  - **Seeker mine explosion**: 5 staggered shockwave rings (was 3) including a white-hot ring and a cyan energy-core ring; shrapnel doubled (22 → 44) with white/cyan/orange-bright color rotation; small particles 18 → 32; embers 12 → 24; new sparkle dust pass (22 specks); secondary cookoff doubled with its own mini flash; new late-game ember rain at +280ms for an afterglow tail. Camera kick 9 → 14, screen shake 8/4 → 14/7, hitstop 4 → 6, screen-flash alpha 0.06 → 0.12.
  - **Lance Beam**: per-frame ionized-air glitter spawns along the beam path (~55% / frame); bright muzzle hotspot at the player's gun mouth; per-hit spark burst on every enemy contact (3 streaks + bright impact flash, throttled per-enemy); per-hit asteroid sparks colored from the rock's own HSL family.
  - **Lightning Arc**: each chain target gets a bright impact flash + 8-spark cyan/white/purple burst + 4 trailing embers; 3 sparkle motes glitter along each segment between links so the bolt path itself shimmers.
  - **Nova Blast**: wavefront crackle — 3-5 sparkles/embers spawn around the ring perimeter every frame; first-frame core flash (size 80) + 14 directional sparks at the origin so the nova has a real "bang" point; per-target impact flash + 6-spark burst as the wavefront crosses each enemy.
  - **Missile impact**: flash size 24 → 36; new ring wavefront; shrapnel 8 → 16 with 4-color cycle; embers 4 → 10; sparkle dust pass; small camera kick + screen shake.
  - **Primary bullet hits (asteroid + enemy)**: shrapnel pieces bumped (4 → 7 / 5 → 8); embers doubled; flash radius bumped 35-40%; sparkle motes added on most hits.
- **MAX_PARTICLES raised 50 → 220** so the pool can hold the new burst sizes without auto-evicting the very particles that just spawned. QA tests updated to spawn 400 and assert ≤ 230.

---

## [5.53.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Cooldown-based power weapons' charging glow now persists through the fully-charged state.** The dispatch site in `player/renderer.js` was guarded by `else if ((this.powerCooldown || 0) > 0)`, so the moment the cooldown reached zero (weapon ready to fire) the glow disappeared entirely — the exact opposite of the charge shot, whose bright ring sustains while fully charged. The gate is removed: cooldown-based weapons (Mine Layer, Nova Blast, Lightning Arc, Missile Salvo) now render the glow continuously — building up as the cooldown elapses, then sustaining the bright fully-charged pulse (powered by `drawChargingGlowCore`'s `isFull` branch) until the player fires, after which the cycle restarts. Now identical to the charge shot's behavior.

---

## [5.53.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Lens-flare nebula parallax on the title screen.** The nebula renderer's `draw()` now accepts an optional `(driftX, driftY)` offset that's applied per-layer scaled by `layer.depth` — closer layers drift more, deepest barely moves — so the lens flare stars wander even when the camera is fixed. The title-screen update branch integrates the existing sandstorm drift vector into a low-multiplier (0.18×) accumulator and feeds it as that drift offset, so the lens flare layers parallax in the same direction as the foreground starfield but at a much slower rate. The accumulator is clamped to ±8000 px to keep numerics tidy across long title-screen visits.

---

## [5.53.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Post-init fade-in to the playfield.** When the title launch animation finishes (screen fully black), `init()` now arms a 700ms black-to-clear overlay that fades in to reveal the player on the empty playfield. After a brief orientation beat (≈400ms), the wave-1 entities warp in. Picks up exactly where the title fade-out left off so the screen never flashes between title and gameplay. Wave 1 timeline is now: 0-700ms fade in → 1100ms spawn entities + grant invincibility → 3400ms state → PLAYING.

### Changed
- **Title launch animation reuses the static title's letters.** Each launch animation now receives the per-letter screen positions of the idle "RAINBOIDS" title (measured from the same `drawWavyText` rendering geometry) and lerps every letter from its static position into the animation's pose over the first 250ms. The on-screen letters appear to BECOME the animation rather than disappearing as a new set of letters spawns elsewhere. Subtitle ("SUPERCHARGED ASTEROIDS"), "PRESS ANY KEY TO START", and the survival-record line stay rendered throughout the launch — they no longer vanish when the animation begins.
- **Cascade animation reworked into a bounce-wave.** The old cascade (letters falling from above with staggered start) implied letters that didn't yet exist, which fought the "use existing letters" rule. The replacement is a bounce-wave ripple: each letter pops up ~78px and back down with a damped sine, staggered left-to-right at 70ms per letter, then the row zooms toward the camera.
- **Title-screen starfield is now a sandstorm.** Replaced the slow ellipse-pattern drift with a multi-frequency chaotic vector — three sine/cosine waves at distinct frequencies sum into a fast, direction-shifting motion. Near-depth stars rip across the field while far ones drift more gently thanks to the existing parallax factor, giving the screen a swirling-sand feel.

---

## [5.52.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Asteroid warp-in subtler and more nuanced.** Asteroids are passive rocks, not energy-projectile arrivals — the previous warp shared the enemy's bright streak with white-hot tip and saturated halo, which felt too "energy-y" for them. The trail now stays in the asteroid's own HSL hue family the entire way (no white tip), the streak is shorter (peak length ~4× the rock vs 11× before), the trail alpha caps at 0.28 (was full opacity), the halo alpha caps at 0.14 (was 0.35), and the scale ramp opens at 0.5 instead of 0.15 so it reads as a quiet phase-in rather than a hard zoom. Warp duration tightened from 700-1500ms to 600-1300ms so rocks don't linger.
- **HUD primary/power weapon squares larger with rounded corners.** Square size 38 → 50 (≈31% larger), corner radius 12, gap between PRM and PWR widened from 8 → 12 to keep proportional breathing room. Label sits 14px below the square (was 12) to match the new size. The cycle-animation glow now strokes a rounded path so the highlight matches the square geometry. Group-X and group-Y anchors unchanged so the squares still align with the gold/coin display directly above.

---

## [5.52.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Wave-start invincibility grace window.** When wave entities spawn (700ms into the wave intro), the player is given 3000ms of invincibility — long enough for the 700-1500ms warp-in to complete plus a beat to orient. Stops the player from being ganked by enemies finishing their warp-in animation right on top of them. Applies to wave 1 and every subsequent wave start.
- **Six title-launch animations, picked randomly.** triggerTitleStart now rolls one of `{twister, explosion, wave, cascade, warpdrive, pinwheel}` and seeds per-letter random data so each press feels fresh:
  - **Twister** (existing) — letters orbit a vertical axis with 3D perspective; column hurtles toward the camera.
  - **Explosion** — letters cluster at center, then fly outward in random 3D directions while spinning; trajectories bias toward the camera so the debris rushes the viewer.
  - **Wave** — horizontal letter row oscillates vertically; both amplitude (14 → 144px) and frequency build as the wave thrashes harder, then the row zooms toward the camera.
  - **Cascade** — letters drop from above the screen with staggered start times, rotating as they fall; once landed, the row zooms toward the viewer.
  - **Warpdrive** — letters streak inward from the screen edges along straight-line vectors, converge in a row at center, then the title zooms in. Like dropping out of hyperspace.
  - **Pinwheel** — letters arranged in a ring spin around screen center; the ring radius pulses, then collapses inward as the camera zooms.

### Changed
- **Wave intro dark overlay disabled.** Both call sites of `drawWaveIntroOverlay` are commented out so the warp-in animations stay visible during wave starts. Re-enable by uncommenting either call. (The `drawWaveIntroOverlay` function itself is preserved.)

---

## [5.51.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Title launch animation reworked into a twister.** Replaced the "spiral the whole title then zoom" treatment with a per-letter twister: each letter of RAINBOIDS orbits a vertical screen-center axis at staggered heights with proper 3D perspective projection (focal length 600), so front-facing letters appear large while back-facing letters fade and shrink. Phases:
  - **0–1100ms — twister formation**: letters spin around the column at 5.5 rad/s; orbit radius eases from 240 → 132 as the column drifts 45% closer.
  - **1100–1500ms — zoom collapse**: orbit radius collapses from 132 → 0 while the column hurtles 95% of the way to the camera; per-letter perspective scale rockets.
  - **1500–1900ms — fade**: final approach + black wash overlays the screen, fading the last sliver of the twister out.
  Total duration 1900ms (was 1700ms). Letter alpha is depth-driven so the back-arc letters dim naturally as they orbit away from the viewer, giving the column visible front/back rotation depth instead of a flat ring.

---

## [5.51.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Animated parallax starfield on the title screen.** The starfield + nebula now generate at engine `start()` (before the title screen renders) and the camera anchors at the gameField center. A synthetic ellipse-pattern drift driven from `update()`'s new TITLE_SCREEN branch keeps the field gently wandering, with each depth layer parallaxing at its own rate via the existing background-star parallax factor. The title text and "PRESS ANY KEY" pulse render on top of the live starfield instead of a black void.
- **RAINBOIDS launch animation when the player presses a key.** The press fires a 1700ms cinematic intro before the actual run starts:
  - **0–700ms — spiral**: the title sweeps two full turns around the screen center while the orbit radius eases from 220px → 0, knotting tighter with each frame.
  - **700–1200ms — zoom**: scale rockets from 1.0 → 6.0 as the title hurtles toward the viewer.
  - **1200–1700ms — fade**: scale grows further while a black wash climbs to full opacity, taking over the screen.
  - When the fade reaches full at 1700ms, `init()` fires and the wave-1 intro overlay (already opaque from frame 1) hands off seamlessly. As the entities warp in and the wave-1 overlay fades out, the player gets a smooth reveal of the playfield.

### Changed
- `start()` now pre-builds the parallax starfield + nebula and centers the camera on the gameField so the title screen has a real animated backdrop.
- Title-screen draw skips the entity / HUD passes (player ship, minimap, powerup HUD, etc.) since pools are empty pre-init and the player ship would otherwise sit at the center of the menu.
- Press-to-start (keypress / click on the title screen) now triggers the launch animation via `gameEngine.triggerTitleStart(callback)`; `init()` runs from the animation's onComplete callback instead of synchronously, so the cinematic plays before gameplay begins.

---

## [5.50.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Flash of game world before the wave intro overlay.** The intro overlay was fading IN over 500ms from alpha 0, which meant the first ~30 frames of the wave transition rendered the world (or shop background) through a near-transparent layer — read as a flash. The overlay now snaps to full opacity on the very first frame of the wave intro; only the fade OUT at the end is animated, so the player gets a clean cut to black followed by a smooth reveal of the warped-in entities.

---

## [5.50.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **20-wave speedrun campaign with four boss waves.** The run is now a single 20-wave arc — meta-goal is "finish as fast as possible." Bosses at waves 5 (Iron Giant — TITAN bossTier 1), 10 (Twin Iron — 2× bossTier 2), 15 (Triple Threat — 3× bossTier 3), and 20 (FINAL BOSS — The Last Stand — 4× bossTier 4 + escorts). Boss enemies receive HP/size/speed multipliers on top of normal level scaling (4×–8× HP, 1.35×–1.75× size, +0–15% speed). When the final wave clears the run transitions to the new GAME_COMPLETE state instead of opening the shop.
- **Game Complete stats screen.** New `GAME_COMPLETE` state renders a dark-backdrop full-screen panel with: total run time (headline stat — speedrun framing), accuracy %, total shots fired, shots on target, damage dealt, damage taken, enemies killed, asteroids destroyed, bosses defeated, coins earned, and preferred weapon (most-fired primary).
- **Run-wide stats tracking.** Every run now tracks: shots fired (per primary weapon), shots that hit, total damage dealt, total damage taken, enemies/asteroids/bosses killed, coins earned, and elapsed time. Stats reset at run start; consumed by the Game Complete screen.

### Changed
- **Wave roster compressed from 100 → 20 waves.** Replaced the multi-act 100-wave roster with a tight 20-wave campaign: Acts I (1-4), Boss 1 (5), II (6-9), Boss 2 (10), III (11-14), Boss 3 (15), IV (16-19), Final Boss (20). Each act has a clear identity, and the final act puts every enemy type on screen at once before the closing boss rush.
- **Scaling re-tuned for a 20-wave arc.** Enemy level now equals wave number (1 → 20 directly, no plateaus). Asteroid level lifts every other wave (1 → 10). Per-level multipliers compressed so the cumulative end-state still feels meaningful at wave 20: enemy HP +10%/level (≈2.9× at wave 20), enemy points +15%/level, asteroid HP +18%/level. Campaign-wide enemy speed multiplier curves from 0.65× at wave 1 to 2.17× at wave 20 — gentle intro, fast late game. Enemy bullet speed scales with the same curve so projectiles match their owners.
- **Enemies never stand still.** Idle states for WASP fish-dart, STALKER knight-move, DRIFTER laser-charge, and TITAN boulder no longer decay velocity to zero — each enemy maintains a slow orbital strafe around the player even between bursts of "real" movement, so the player has to track them every frame instead of ignoring them between actions.

### Fixed
- DRIFTER enemies used to lock to a dead-stop while charging or cooling down their laser, which made them feel asleep. They now slow-strafe around the player throughout charge/cooldown.
- TITAN bosses no longer come to a complete halt between charges — the brake state seeds a fresh orbit sign and the idle state drives a slow tangential drift.

---

## [5.49.9] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Wave-start dark intro overlay.** WAVE_TRANSITION now renders a full-screen near-opaque dark overlay with the wave title (and pithy subtitle) dead center. The overlay fades in over 500ms, holds for the wave's spawn-and-warp window, then fades out over 700ms (total intro = 2800ms). The existing top-of-screen wavy text is reserved for shorter notifications (WAVE COMPLETE, queued toasts) — wave starts get the cinematic centered treatment.
- **Asteroid warp-in entry animation.** Asteroids now warp in like enemies — streak gradient, scale ramp, and brief soft halo at the materialization point. The streak color is sampled from the asteroid's own HSL palette so each rock's entry feels coherent with its body color. Warping asteroids skip player/bullet/enemy/asteroid/lance/mine/nova/missile collisions while warping (they're not "really there" until the warp finishes).

### Changed
- **Refined warp-in animation — smoother, with scale.** Replaced the cubic-ease-in-then-snap "Star Trek" curve with smoothstep position interpolation (no hard arrival snap) and an ease-out scale ramp from 0.15 → 1.0. Entities now grow visibly as they warp in instead of flashing into existence at full size. Warp duration baseline lifted to 700-1500ms (was 400-1200ms) so the scale-in reads clearly. The streak's stretch intensity follows `sin(πt)` so it peaks at the smoothstep's max-velocity midpoint and tapers smoothly at both ends, and the bright "snap" arrival flash is replaced with a soft halo that fades alongside the streak.
- **All asteroid spawn paths now use warp-in.** Wave-start asteroids warp into the visible viewport from just outside the closest viewport edge (220-380px) so the pre-wave dark overlay fades to reveal them already on-camera. Continuous in-wave spawns and force-spawn / cheat asteroids warp from outside the gameField edge to a random target inside the play area's middle 60%. The previous "drift in slowly from off-map" behavior is gone — every asteroid arrival is now a deliberate warp event.
- **Wave intro timing reordered.** Wave-start spawning now fires at t=700ms (overlay near peak darkness) instead of t=2000ms, so the 700-1500ms warp animation finishes during the overlay's fade-out window. State flips to PLAYING at t=2800ms.

---

## [5.49.8] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Wave-start asteroids and enemies now spawn inside the visible viewport.** Previously wave-start entities were placed at the gameField edges (asteroids 120–240px, enemies 200–400px outside the 1920×1080 world) and had to drift / warp in. If the player was moving at the moment the wave kicked off, those entities would pop onto the screen mid-warp or appear well behind the player. Wave-start spawning now picks positions inside the camera's current viewport at a safe minimum distance from the player (220px+ radius for asteroids, 260px for enemies), avoiding the minimap overlay, with an inner edge pad so nothing spawns flush against the screen edge. Enemies still warp in, but the warp source is now just outside the closest viewport edge (220–380px) so the streak is brief and visually anchored to the screen — they're already on-camera from frame one of the wave. Continuous in-wave spawns and cheat-key spawns keep the original off-gameField behavior so they still feel like they're entering from far away.

---

## [5.49.7] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Nebula renderer simplified to lens-flare stars only.** All blob, halo, and core gas-cloud rendering passes removed. Each parallax layer now bakes only bright pinpoint stars with soft halos and 4-arm diffraction spikes — the dark canvas shows through between them instead of being washed by a haze of overlapping gas fields. Star counts cut sharply (6 / 9 / 12 / 16 across the four parallax depths) so the lens-flare stars read as sparse accents sprinkled across the void rather than a dense field.
- **Background and color star brightness raised.** `depth-batch-renderer` opacity floors bumped (background 0.4 → 0.7, color stars 0.5 → 0.8) so even far-depth stars are clearly visible. `background-star` radius scales increased and brightness baseline lifted to 230-255, with the twinkle amplitude tightened to 0.10-0.20 — stars stay consistently bright instead of fading to half-visible at the bottom of each twinkle cycle. No new draw calls; depth-bucket batching path unchanged.
- **Charging body-glow now plays for every power weapon.** Previously only `CHARGE_SHOT` showed the building cyan-blue body glow while charging. Cooldown-based powers (Mine Layer, Nova Blast, Lightning Arc, Missile Salvo) now show the same animated glow as their cooldown elapses — progress derived from `1 - powerCooldown/powerCooldownMax`, transitioning through "charging → basic charged → fully charged" states with matching pulse speeds and ring/spark effects. The shared rendering body is factored into a single `drawChargingGlowCore` helper consumed by both `drawChargingEffects` (charge-based) and the new `drawCooldownChargingEffects` (cooldown-based); dispatch picks one or the other based on the active power weapon's `isChargeBased` flag.

---

## [5.49.6] - 2026-05-03

### Removed
- **All "haze" passes from the nebula renderer.** Cumulatively they were laying a uniform fog over the entire canvas. Gone:
  - **Stardust speckles** — 30-90 tiny dots per layer biased to blob interiors. `_drawStardust` deleted.
  - **Filament threads** — 12-22 short streaky bright gradients per layer. `_drawFilament` deleted.
  - **Dust lanes** — 0-3 dark absorbing silhouettes per blob. `_drawDustLane` deleted.
  - **Wisps** — bowed gradient chains connecting blob centers. `_drawWisp` deleted.
  - **Sky tint** — faint full-canvas radial wash per layer. `_drawSkyTint` deleted.
- LAYER_CONFIG fields removed: `speckles`, `speckleAlpha`, `wispCount`, `dustLanesPerBlob`, `filamentCount`.

### Result
- Each nebula layer now renders only **structured passes**: blob bodies (with shadow + body + edge halo + hot core, density-profile mix, ellipse asymmetry, palette-pool sampling, HSL jitter — all preserved) and the **lens-flare embedded stars** (bright pinpoints with halos and 4-pointy diffraction spikes). Blobs sit cleanly on the dark canvas instead of bleeding through a global haze.

---

## [5.49.5] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Nebula realism pass — embedded stars, dust lanes, filament threads.** Three new render passes per layer that turn the gas fields from "smooth color blobs" into something that reads as a real space photograph.
  - **Embedded stars** (6-12 per layer, biased to blob interiors) — bright pinpoint cores with soft halos and 4-arm diffraction spikes (cross pattern, random rotation per star). Star colors mix 70% hot blue-white / 20% palette accent / 10% highlight; the brightest stars get a hot white center pixel. THE iconic "this is a space photograph" cue.
  - **Dust lanes** (0-3 per blob, denser on near layers) — dark elongated absorption silhouettes painted *over* the gas, mimicking the dust lanes that bisect Trifid / Eagle / Lagoon-type emission nebulae. Drawn as a long thin ellipse with a shadow-color radial gradient that fades at the ends.
  - **Filament threads** (12-22 per layer) — short streaky bright gradients tangent to blob outer edges, where shock fronts produce thin filament structures in real nebulae. Sampled tone, ellipse-stretched, biased to the outer 0.55-1.05× radius.

---

## [5.49.4] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Nebula color richness pass — pool sampling + per-blob HSL jitter.**
  - Each scene palette now declares **6-7 body tones + 2-3 accents** instead of fixed primary/secondary/tertiary/accent slots. Per-blob renders pick 3 distinct random tones for the gradient stops + 1 random accent for the halo, so different blobs in the same scene have visibly different color personalities while staying in the family.
  - **Per-blob HSL hue/saturation/lightness jitter** (±15° hue, ±0.08 sat, ±0.05 light) shifts the picked colors before drawing — even the same triplet won't render identically twice. Sub-blobs within a blob get a small additional jitter on top so the volumetric layering reads as naturally varying gas, not flat repeats.
  - **Two new scene palettes**: `twilight-spectrum` (multi-hue blue→violet→pink dusk) and `solar-corona` (burning yellow/orange/red-hot). 10 total palettes.
  - **Body gradient widened to 6 stops** (was 4) — smoother transitions through the 3 sampled tones.
  - **Hot core now blends `highlight + inner tone`** instead of always neutral white, so the nucleus inherits palette identity.
  - **Wisps and sky tints sample tones randomly per render** rather than always using primary/secondary/tertiary, so connecting filaments and the layer wash also vary in color.
  - **Speckles**: 75% pure white / 18% random accent (from the accents pool) / 7% highlight — colored stardust diversifies the field.

---

## [5.49.3] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Nebula refinement pass — depth, asymmetry, and detail.**
  - **Two new scene palettes**: `emerald-jade` (rare verdant accent) and `rose-petal` (gentle pink/magenta), bringing the total to 8.
  - **Per-palette `accent` color** added to every scene palette; used for chromatic edge halos around blobs and 15% of speckles, so the gas has visible color complexity rather than a single hue ramp.
  - **Sky tint per layer** — faint full-canvas radial wash in the layer's secondary color anchors each layer in the palette and prevents detached-patches feel. Strength scales with layer luminance.
  - **Density profiles per blob** — each blob is randomly assigned `bright` (25%, vivid + halo + hot core), `normal` (55%, the workhorse), or `haze` (20%, oversized + dim + no core). Visual rhythm replaces the previous uniform brightness.
  - **Elliptical sub-blobs** — sub-blobs now render as ellipses with random aspect (0.6× to 1.6×) and random rotation, not perfect circles. Overall nebula shape reads as gas/cloud rather than bubbles.
  - **Edge halos** — thin chromatic ring at the outer 22% of bright/normal blobs in the accent color. Adds silhouette interest.
  - **Stardust variety** — speckle colors mix 80% pure speckle / 15% accent / 5% highlight; sizes mix 70% small / 25% medium / 5% bright stars (with a tiny corona on the brightest).

---

## [5.49.2] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Nebula generation rebuilt for stronger parallax, depth, and palette consistency.**
  - **Strong parallax**: layer depth range expanded from 0.02–0.12 (max ~12% relative motion) to **0.0–0.65** (5.4× stronger). Far layer is now fully locked to camera; near layer moves at 65% of camera speed. Player movement actually parallaxes the background.
  - **One palette per scene**: `generate()` commits a single `SCENE_PALETTES` entry (cobalt-deep / violet-nursery / teal-aurora / ember-warmth / periwinkle-dream / crimson-ultraviolet) and every layer + blob + wisp + speckle pulls from it. No more per-sub-blob palette mixing that produced clashing color salads.
  - **Per-layer atmospheric perspective**: each of the 4 layers gets a `lumMul` (0.45 / 0.65 / 0.85 / 1.00) that shades the scene palette darker for far layers, brighter for near layers — sells "this is depth, not just stacking."
  - **Faux-3D blob structure**: each blob now renders in 3 passes — shadow body (offset, dark, oversized), main body (multi-stop palette gradient), and a small bright off-center hot core. Layered together they read as volumetric clouds rather than flat radial disks.
  - **Filament wisps**: 1–4 elongated soft gradient chains per layer connect random pairs of blob centers along bowed paths, suggesting gas streams between density peaks.
  - **Stardust speckle**: 30–90 tiny dots per layer biased toward blob centers (sqrt-distance distribution for higher density at the core), giving the gas a grainy texture.

---

## [5.49.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Powerup acronym refinements** — bumped 6 to 4 letters where the 3-letter form was unclear or ambiguous: `SHD → SHLD`, `CRT → CRIT`, `CDM → CDMG`, `EXP → EXPL`, `KBK → KNCK`, `AFB → BURN`. The other 14 stay at 3 letters.
- **Lance Beam tuned for "low DPS, long uptime."** Per-frame damage halved (0.15 → 0.06; 9 dps → 3.6 dps), beam duration 5× longer (400ms → 2000ms), cooldown bumped 1200ms → 2200ms. The beam stays on far longer per activation but chips at targets gently — feels sustained rather than burst-y. Description updated to "Sustained energy beam — low DPS, long uptime".

---

## [5.49.0] - 2026-05-03

### Removed
- **All jsfxr-generated SFX gone.** `js/modules/audio/sound-defs.js`, `tools/scripts/generate-sfx.js`, `tools/scripts/probe-audio-polyphony.mjs`, and the entire `sfx/` directory (manifest + 28 WAVs) deleted. They were causing audio glitches in flight. The `AudioManager` class is preserved as a no-op silent layer so every `playShoot()` / `playHit()` / `playSound(name)` call short-circuits without touching the audio context. Background music continues to play via `MusicPlayer` and `HTMLAudioElement`. External WAV assets will be wired into `playSound()` later.

### Fixed
- **Lance Beam now actually damages and pushes asteroids.** `checkLanceBeamCollisions` previously only hit enemies. It now sweeps the same point-to-line test against the asteroid pool, applies damage, sets a hit-flash, and shoves each hit asteroid forward by `0.4 px/frame × knockMul × 0.6` (gentler than enemies because asteroids are heavier). Lethal damage routes through `destroyAsteroid` for the proper destruction sequence. Snapshots `asteroidPool.activeObjects` before iterating so spawned fragments don't enter the same scan.
- **Lance Beam grows in instead of popping on at full size.** `weapon-effects-renderer` now reads `beamMaxDuration - beamTimer` to derive a 0→1 ease-out cubic over the first 150ms, scaling both width and reach. Beam line is also broken into 6+ jagged zig-zag segments with perpendicular jitter — sustained sister of the lightning-arc visual.
- **Stale benchmark suite paths fixed.** Imports under `tools/benchmark/scripts/*.bench.js` referenced `../../js/...` which resolved to `tools/js/...` (one level too shallow). Bumped to `../../../js/...`. All 7 microbenchmarks now run cleanly.

### Changed
- **Bottom-of-screen powerup HUD is compact** — full names replaced with 3-letter abbreviations (RPD, MUL, HOM, BIG, AFB, PRC, EXP, CRT, CDM, SHD, RNG, KBK, MED, DOC, PAY, HRL, HLK, GLK, HBT, GBT). New `abbr` field on each entry in `POWERUP_TYPES`; the HUD reads it (with a fallback to `name.slice(0, 3).toUpperCase()`).
- **Hover tooltip on each HUD powerup badge.** `data-tooltip="Full Name — full description"` set in `syncPowerupHUD`; CSS `:hover::after` pops a 12px Silkscreen panel above the badge with an arrow pointer (zero delay, mirrors the music-player tooltip pattern).
- **Powerups pause-menu cards now show "Name (ABV)"** so the player learns the codes that show up on the HUD.

### Tests
- Unit suite: 68/68 passing.
- QA smoke suite: 95/95 passing.
- All 7 microbenchmarks run cleanly.

---

## [5.48.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Bullet-hell pass: frenetic intro, faster economy, faster scaling.**
  - **Enemy HP slashed across the board** (~30-40% off the 5.45-era values): Hunter 5→3, Wasp 4→3, Weaver 5→3, Stalker 6→4, Drifter 7→5, Bomber 8→6, Sentinel 8→6, Guardian 10→7, Prowler 11→8, Titan 18→12.
  - **Asteroid HP halved**: big tier 4-7 → 3-5, medium 2-4 → 1-3, small now one-shot (was 1-2).
  - **Enemy reward points bumped ~60%** so kills feed the economy fast: Hunter 75→120, Wasp 60→100, Stalker 80→130, Weaver 100→160, Bomber 100→160, Drifter 120→180, Guardian 120→200, Sentinel 140→220, Prowler 150→240, Titan 200→320.
  - **XP gain doubled per hit** (asteroid 2→4, enemy 3→6) and kill-XP ratio bumped (was `points/5`, now `points/3`) — the player levels up quickly enough to engage with skills/upgrades within the first few waves.
- **Early waves are now dense.** Wave 1: 6 asteroids + 3 hunters (was 2+1). Waves 2-15 scaled accordingly — 8-11 asteroids, 3-5 enemies each. Steeper feel, more pressure, designed to push the player into the shop early for upgrades.
- **Difficulty scaling is steeper**: enemy level now climbs every 3 waves (was every 5); per-level enemy stats grow 25% HP / 15% speed / 20% points (was 20/10/20).
- **Concurrent caps raised** to support the density without choking: `MAX_ASTEROIDS` 4 → 16, `MAX_WAVE_ASTEROIDS` 12 → 16.

### Tests
- `tests/unit/wave.test.js` updated for the new wave-data shape — strict per-phase enemy-type counts replaced with average-of-phase assertions, MAX_WAVE_ASTEROIDS bumped to 16, procedural-types test scoped to `> 100` only.
- `tests/qa/05-entities.spec.js` — explosion-particle test now drains the pool first so `MAX_PARTICLES` saturation can't make `before === after`.
- `tests/qa/06-pools.spec.js` — release-back-to-pool test rewritten to compare `freeAfterGet` vs `freeAfterRelease` rather than relying on initial pool length being zero.
- `tests/qa/07-weapons.spec.js` — shop-tab tests rewritten for the new layout (5 tabs: HELP/PRIMARY/POWER/DEFENSE/SKILLS, no OFFENSE/DROPS, DOM-based selectors), weapon-purchase tests removed (weapons equipped from pause menu, not bought from shop), Tab-cycle test added.

### Test results
- Unit suite: **68/68 passing**.
- QA smoke suite: **95/95 passing** in ~2:20.

---

## [5.47.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Game no longer skips straight to wave 2.** Two race conditions in the wave-start sequence were letting `checkWaveComplete` see `state === PLAYING && totalEnemies === 0 && !waveComplete` for a moment before the wave's enemies actually spawned, instantly declaring the wave complete and popping the shop for wave 2:
  - `init()` set `state = PLAYING` early on line 382 before later flipping to `WAVE_TRANSITION` on line 435. Now `init()` lands in `WAVE_TRANSITION` directly.
  - The wave-1 spawn timer (and the per-wave `startNextWave` timer) flipped state to `PLAYING` *before* calling `spawnWaveEntities()`. Order swapped — spawn first, then flip state — so the wave-complete check can never observe the empty-pool window.

---

## [5.47.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Mine Layer renamed to Seeker Mines.** Description: "Magnetic seekers that hunt and detonate". Mines now actively pursue enemies and asteroids and self-detonate if they fail to make contact.
- **Seeker behavior**: once armed, each mine acquires the nearest enemy/asteroid within 360px and steers toward it via smooth angle interpolation. Slow creeper speed (`MINE_MAX_SPEED = 1.4 px/frame`, `MINE_ACCEL = 0.06`, `MINE_TURN = 0.08`). Re-acquires when its target dies; drifts with a gentle 0.95 drag if no target is in sight. Magnetic pull on nearby entities still applies — mines and targets converge from both sides.
- **12s self-detonation lifetime** with a 2s urgent-blink telegraph at the end. `mine.lifeTimer` ticks down once armed; when it hits 0 the mine sets `mine.expired = true` and `collision-system.checkMineCollisions` fires the same explosion path as a proximity trigger.
- **Renderer urgent state** in the last 2s of life: blink rate ramps from ~0.012 to ~0.052, casing tints toward red (`#3a0000` body, `#ff2200` stroke when blink-on), core pulses orange-red. Calm state and pre-arm visuals unchanged.

---

## [5.46.3] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Missiles fan out from the ship's wings.** Per-slot launch position now offsets along the ship's perpendicular axis (`±9px × slot`), so each missile visibly leaves a different point across the wings instead of all spawning at the ship's center. Per-slot fan angle bumped 0.3 → 0.5 rad for a more dramatic spread.
- **Missile silhouette rebuilt as a proper rocket** with sharper nose cone, cylindrical body with a band, two swept-back aft fins (top + bottom, filled), and a small centered tail fin. Pulsing nose light + amber side LEDs preserved.
- **Missiles blink out as their range expires.** Mirrors the powerup-expiry blink — frequency ramps from ~2Hz at 800ms remaining up to ~14Hz right before the missile times out. `fireMissiles` stashes `maxLife: 3000` for any future range tuning.

---

## [5.46.2] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Centered the "Click a weapon to equip it" hint** in the PRIMARY and POWER pause-menu tabs (added `text-align: center` to both `<div>` instances).

---

## [5.46.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Lightning Arc origin tracks the player ship.** The first chain link's `targets[0]` is now refreshed every frame from `player.x/y` during the 500ms visual window, so the arc visibly follows the ship as it moves instead of frozen at the cast position.

### Changed
- **Powerups menu moved back into the normal pause-menu tab strip** alongside Music / SFX / Skills. Removed the standalone `#powerups-overlay`, the `pause-powerups-button` action button, and the ESC-overlay handling. The Powerups pause-tab itself contains the OFFENSE / DROPS sub-tab row + card list and renders via `switchTab('powerups')`. Title centered.

### Removed
- **"Chiplight" track removed** from the music library (`music/chiplight.mp3` deleted, playlist regenerated → 67 tracks).

---

## [5.46.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **`KNOCKBACK` powerup** — new offense pickup. +30% knockback per stack on **all** power weapons (Mine, Nova, Lightning, Missile), capped at 3×. Drives a new `Player.getKnockbackMultiplier()` method consulted by every collision handler that applies impulse.
- **All power weapons now apply knockback to enemies AND asteroids**:
  - Mine (already pushed) — multiplier-aware now.
  - Nova (already pushed) — multiplier-aware now.
  - **Lightning Arc**: each chain link nudges its target along the bolt direction (`6 × knockMul` for enemies, `0.6×` of that for asteroids). Visibly drags targets along the chain.
  - **Missiles**: hits push the target along the missile's heading (`9 × knockMul` for enemies, `0.6×` for asteroids).
- **Powerups overlay** — Shop-like page (`#powerups-overlay`) with **OFFENSE** and **DROPS** sub-tabs that lists every powerup type, owned or not, with stack counts. Cards show name, color-coded icon, description, and `×N` stack badge (or `—` for unowned). Driven by `UIManager.renderPowerupsOverlay()`.
- **Pause menu Powerups action button** — `pause-powerups-button` sits at the top of the pause menu alongside SHOP and RESUME. Clicking it opens the Powerups overlay. ESC closes overlay back to pause.

### Changed
- **All powerup pickups are now permanent and stacking** — no temporary timers. `Player.addPowerup` ignores the `duration` field on the config and treats every pickup as `isPermanent: true` with infinite `timeRemaining`. Drop powerups now persist for the rest of the run instead of expiring after 30s.
- **POWERUP_TYPES gained a `category` field** (`OFFENSE` or `DROPS`) on every entry. Drop-rarity values lowered across the board (rare permanent stacking — economy needed re-tuning to avoid runaway scaling).
- **Removed OFFENSE and DROPS shop categories.** The shop now only sells PRIMARY/POWER weapons, DEFENSE upgrades, and SKILLS. The corresponding offense/drops upgrades are picked up as permanent powerups in-game. SPARE_SHIP moved from OFFENSE to DEFENSE (still gold-priced). Updated both the DOM shop tabs (`index.html`) and the legacy canvas-renderer tabs list (`shop-renderer.js`).
- **POWERUPS pause-tab removed** from the tab strip — that view was promoted to a top-level overlay accessed via the new action button. The old `#powerups-tab` panel was deleted from HTML; `UIManager.updatePowerupsList()` is kept as a back-compat shim that calls `renderPowerupsOverlay()`.
- BIG_BULLETS description updated to reflect the additive `+1.5px per stack` behavior introduced in 5.40.15.

---

## [5.45.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Power weapons now produce full asteroid destruction (debris, color stars, orb drops, powerup chance, screen shake, fragmentation)** when they kill an asteroid, instead of the asteroid silently disappearing with just a death flash. Mine, Nova, Lightning, and Missile kill paths all routed through a new shared `destroyAsteroid()` helper that mirrors the bullet-hit kill sequence — including spawning 3-4 fragments for large asteroids. Each AOE loop snapshots `asteroidPool.activeObjects` before iterating so newly-spawned fragments don't re-trigger the same blast frame.

---

## [5.45.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **All player mines are now magnetic by default** — they pull nearby enemies and asteroids toward themselves. Pull radius is `1.8 ×` the trigger radius (so BLAST_RADIUS investments grow magnetism too); pull force scales with `(1 - dist/pullR)`. Asteroids feel a gentler tug than enemies (heavier mass).
  - Removed the `MAGNETIC_MINE` upgrade from `POWER_UPGRADES` and `MINE_LAYER.upgrades` since it's now baseline.
  - Added a faint dashed blue magnetic-field ring outside the trigger ring on the mine renderer so the pull radius is visible. The dash offset shifts over time for a "field rotating" feel.
  - Mine description updated: "Drop magnetic proximity mines".
- **Nova Blast is now a real shockwave**: ringRadius bumped 200 → 320, ringDamage 2.5 → 4, duration 500 → 600ms. Casting now spawns an immediate explosive burst at the player (flash + ring + 24 shrapnel streaks + 14 embers) plus 4-frame hitstop, screen flash, and screen shake.
- **Nova damages and pushes asteroids too**, not only enemies. Both enemies and asteroids get an outward velocity shove on first ring contact (`KNOCK_ENEMY=16`, `KNOCK_AST=9`). Lethal damage flips `_deathFlash` and deactivates asteroids.
- **Lightning Arc chains through asteroids too.** Chain-target search now considers both `enemyPool` and `asteroidPool`; collision applies falloff damage to whichever kind of target each link is. Asteroids get hit-flash + death-flash on lethal damage.
- **Missiles also impact and damage asteroids.** Homing target acquisition prefers enemies, falls back to nearest asteroid if none in sight. Collision check iterates both pools; impact spawns a flash + shrapnel + embers burst.

---

## [5.44.0] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Nova Blast actually does damage now.** Three latent bugs: `p.novaActive` was never set so collision/render gated out entirely; `ring.active` was never set; skills.js wrote `ring.radius` while collision/render read `ring.currentRadius`. Fixed all three: `fireNova` flips `novaActive=true` and `active=true` on each ring, skills.js writes `currentRadius`, and `novaActive` is cleared when the rings array drains.
- **Lightning Arc actually damages enemies now.** `chain.targets` was never populated and `chain.active` was never set, so the renderer drew nothing and collision iterated an empty list. `fireLightning` now eagerly builds the chain: pulls `enemyPool` from `this.gameEngine`, repeatedly picks the nearest unvisited enemy within `chainRange` of the previous link, up to `maxChains` hops. Targets render as zig-zag arcs and collision applies falloff damage along the chain.
- **Missile Salvo actually homes and connects now.** Skills update never applied homing — missiles flew straight ignoring `homingStrength`. Renderer also accessed non-existent `missile.vx` / `missile.vy` (data has `missile.vel.x` / `missile.vel.y`). Now missiles re-acquire the nearest active enemy and steer toward it via smooth angular interpolation.

### Changed
- **Missiles redrawn vector-style** with a dart-shaped body, fins, gradient thruster flame trail, pulsing nose-cone light, and steady amber side LEDs. Rotates to face its current heading.
- **Homing is always on for missiles**; `LOCK_ON` upgrade removed. Base `missileHomingStrength` bumped from 0.08 → 0.18 so the always-on homing actually grabs targets. `MISSILE_SALVO.upgrades` array no longer references `LOCK_ON`.

---

## [5.43.0] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Nova / Lightning / Missile power weapons had no cooldown without their per-weapon upgrade.** `fireNova` / `fireLightning` / `fireMissiles` only set `powerCooldown` when their respective upgrade (`RESONANCE` / `TESLA_COIL` / `QUICK_RELOAD`) had at least 1 stack — without the upgrade, the weapon was spammable. Now each weapon always sets its base cooldown; the upgrade just shortens it.

### Added
- **Universal power-weapon readiness ring on the player ship.** The cooldown timer (formerly only drawn for `CHARGE_SHOT` while charging) now fires for every power weapon. For cooldown-based weapons (Mine Layer, Nova, Lightning, Missiles) the ring fills as `1 - powerCooldown/powerCooldownMax`, then pulses fully-charged white/cyan when ready to fire — same visual language across all power weapons. Each weapon's fire path now stashes `this.powerCooldownMax` so the renderer can draw progress.
- **Mines now produce a fantastic explosion**: bright core flash (1.2× blast radius), three staggered colored rings (orange / dim / bright wavefronts), 22 directional shrapnel streaks, 18 dense classic particles, 12 lingering embers, and a delayed cookoff burst at +120ms. Plus 4-frame hitstop, screen flash, camera kick, screen shake, and an explosion audio cue. Modeled on the asteroid-death debris recipe in `combat-manager.createDebris`.
- **Mines push enemies and asteroids around with momentum**: outward velocity push scales linearly with proximity to the mine. `KNOCK_BASE = 12` for enemies (lighter, fly farther), `KNOCK_BASE = 6` for asteroids (heavier). Close-range targets get nearly the full impulse; targets at the edge of the blast barely move.

---

## [5.42.0] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Mines actually arm and explode now.** `mine.armed` was never set anywhere in the codebase — `collision-system.checkMineCollisions` short-circuited with `if (!mine.armed) continue;` so the explosion path never fired. `skills.js` now flips `mine.armed = true` once `armTimer <= 0`. Latent bug since the mine system landed.

### Changed
- **Mines now explode near asteroids too**, not only enemies. Trigger detection iterates `asteroidPool` in addition to `enemyPool`; the blast also damages asteroids with the same falloff (and applies a hit-flash + outward knockback for impact feel). Lethal damage flips `_deathFlash` and deactivates the asteroid.
- **`BLAST_RADIUS` upgrade now boosts trigger range too** (+20px per stack alongside the existing +30px blast radius). Description updated to reflect both effects. Investing in the upgrade now genuinely extends the mine's *effective range* — the spirit the user asked about.
- **Mines redesigned to look physical and tangible.** Replaced the 8px circle with a chunky 12px casing: 4 spike protrusions, dark filled body with colored outline, a pulsing inner core, a 6-LED rotating ring with chase-pattern blink, a status blinker on top, and a flashing trigger-radius ring while armed. Pre-arm visuals are dimmer with a faster telegraph blink.
- **Mine explosion VFX upgraded** — was 8 generic particles, now uses the same flash + colored ring + 14 shrapnel streaks + 6 embers that powerup-expiry uses, scaled to blast radius.

---

## [5.41.8] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Powerup pickup display now shows what the powerup does**, not just its name. A one-line effect blurb (e.g. "Increases the max amount of health per orb" for Doctor) renders directly below the wavy powerup name. Description is pulled from `POWERUP_TYPES[type].description` in `powerup.js`. Threaded through `collectPowerup` → `showPowerupDisplay(name, color, description)` → `powerupDisplay.description` → `drawPowerupDisplay` (renders white Silkscreen text with a black outline). Removes the "what does Doctor do?" mystery on every pickup.

---

## [5.41.7] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Weapon squares' vertical gap to the coin icon now matches the shield→coin gap exactly.** The 30px shield and 30px coin icons sit 40px center-to-center, giving a 10px edge-to-edge gap. The squares previously sat 40px below the coin *center* (25px edge-to-edge gap) — visually inconsistent with the column above. Now `groupY = coinsY + coinIconSize/2 + 10` so all three vertical gaps (shield↔coin, coin↔squares) are an even 10px.

---

## [5.41.6] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Top-left HUD has more screen-edge breathing room and the weapon squares now align with the gold icon.**
  - Bumped the shared `livesX` anchor from 24 → 36 (across `drawCanvasTriforce`, `drawLevelAndCoinsDisplay`, `drawEquippedWeaponSquares`, `drawMoneyPickupDisplay`); health-bar `barX` shifted 74 → 86 to keep the gap to the triforce.
  - Primary weapon square's **left edge now aligns with the gold-coin icon's left edge** instead of the HUD column's left margin. Computed via the same `triforceCenterX - coinIconSize/2` formula the gold display uses.
  - Both weapon squares moved further down: vertical gap from coin icon → squares is now 40px (matching the level→coin icon-to-icon spacing of the column above), so the weapon row breathes instead of crowding the gold number.

---

## [5.41.5] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Tab and R now cycle through every weapon in the game one-by-one**, not just the player's currently-owned set. Pressing Tab walks through all 5 primaries (Pulse Cannon → Storm Needles → Scatter Gun → Rail Driver → Lance Beam → back); R walks through all 5 power weapons (Charge Shot → Mine Layer → Nova Blast → Lightning Arc → Missile Salvo → back). The newly-equipped weapon is auto-added to `ownedPrimaries` / `ownedPowers` so the rest of the game (shop upgrade trees, sell paths) treats it as owned — mirrors the existing pause-menu PRIMARY/POWER tab behavior. Removed the no-op hints that fired when only one weapon was owned (no longer reachable).

---

## [5.41.4] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Top-left HUD column now has a clear left margin.** Bumped the shared anchor from `livesX = 10` → `livesX = 24` in all four sites that anchor to it: `drawCanvasTriforce`, `drawLevelAndCoinsDisplay`, `drawEquippedWeaponSquares`, `drawMoneyPickupDisplay`. Health-bar `barX` shifted from 60 → 74 to preserve the gap to the triforce.
- **Tab/R cycle: clearer feedback when only one weapon is owned.** Previously the HUD square pulsed but nothing else happened, leaving the player wondering whether the binding was broken or whether they simply lacked a second weapon. Now in that case a non-persistent hint fires: "Equip another primary in the **pause menu (ESC → PRIMARY)** to cycle weapons with **Tab**" (and the analogous message for R / power weapons). Each instance is freshly shown (the hint uses `{ once: false }`) so the prompt isn't suppressed by the once-per-browser persistence layer that gates the wave-1 onboarding hints.

---

## [5.41.3] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **PRM weapon square no longer clips off the left edge of the screen.** Was centered under the 60px triforce width with a 84px-wide group → `groupX = -2`. Switched to left-anchored at `livesX = 10` so both squares share the same left margin as the rest of the top-left HUD column.
- **Tab / R weapon cycling now also works during WAVE_TRANSITION** (between-wave usability), not just `PLAYING`.
- **Tab / R always pulse the HUD square** even when the player owns only one weapon of that type. Previously the keys were silent no-ops in that case, making it look like the binding was broken. Now the player always gets visual confirmation the key was received; the actual weapon swap only happens when 2+ weapons are owned.

---

## [5.41.2] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Tab now cycles primary weapons; R cycles power weapons.** R was previously the only cycle key (primary-only). Tab needs `e.preventDefault()` so the browser doesn't shift focus to the next page element.
- HUD cycle animation extended: `_weaponCycleAnim` now carries a `slot` field (`'primary'` or `'power'`) and `drawEquippedWeaponSquares` pulses whichever square just changed.
- Wave-1 onboarding hint updated to: "Press **Tab** to cycle primary weapons, **R** to cycle power weapons." Hint id bumped to `wave1-cycle-weapons-v2` so players who already saw the old "Press R" hint see the new dual-key version once.
- README controls updated for both keys.

---

## [5.41.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Shop PRIMARY / POWER tabs now show which weapon you're upgrading.** A banner at the top of each tab displays "Upgrading Primary Weapon" / "Upgrading Power Weapon" with the equipped weapon's icon, name, and color (`buildEquippedBanner` in `shop-dom.js`). Removes ambiguity about which upgrade tree the listed items will modify.
- **Equipped-weapons HUD: two squares below the gold display** showing the equipped Primary and Power weapons. Each square has the weapon's icon centered in its weapon color, with **PRM** / **PWR** labels below. New `drawEquippedWeaponSquares` exported from `hud/status.js` and called after `drawLevelAndCoinsDisplay`.
- **R-cycle animation**: pressing R now triggers a 350ms scale-pulse + glow halo on the Primary HUD square via a new `triggerWeaponCycleAnim()` on the game engine and a `_weaponCycleAnim` state object read by the HUD renderer. The animation auto-clears when its duration elapses.

---

## [5.41.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **R cycles through primary weapons during gameplay.** Rotates through the player's owned primaries (`activePrimary` → next entry in `ownedPrimaries`). No-op when only one weapon is owned. Ignored while Shift is held to avoid colliding with Shift+R cheat patterns.
- **Contextual hint overlay system** (`js/modules/ui/hint-system.js`). One-at-a-time tooltip pinned above the HUD, fades in/out, auto-dismisses after a configurable duration. Each hint id is shown at most once per browser via `localStorage` (key `rainboids:hints-shown:v1`). Authors can pass `<strong>` to highlight key glyphs in hint text. Exports `showHint(id, text, durationMs)`, `hideHint()`, and `resetHints()` (for dev/testing). New `#hint-overlay` element in `index.html` plus styling in `css/styles.css`.
- **Two onboarding hints during wave 1** (queued via `GameTimer` so they pause with the game):
  - At ~5s: "Press **R** to cycle through your primary weapons." Auto-dismisses after 7s, or instantly when the player actually presses R.
  - At ~13s: "Open the **shop** any time — pause menu (**ESC**) or the **🛒** button in the top-right." Auto-dismisses after 8s.

### Changed
- README.md `Controls` section updated: documents R-cycle, and corrects the shop entry-point note (top-right HUD button + pause menu, not "pause menu only").

---

## [5.40.15] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Temporary powerups now apply consistently across every primary weapon.** Three previously-divergent powerups harmonized:
  - **BIG_BULLETS** — switched from multiplicative (`radius *= 1 + stacks * 0.3`) to **additive** (`radius += 1.5px * stacks`). Old behavior under-served small-bullet weapons: at 1 stack, Pulse Cannon grew from r=4 to r=5.2 (+1.2px) but Storm Needles only grew from r=2 to r=2.6 (+0.6px) — barely visible. New behavior gives every weapon the same Δpx per stack regardless of base bullet size, so the "bullets are bigger now" promise reads visually on every primary.
  - **HOMING** — unified the per-stack formula. Was `min(0.4, stacks * 0.05)` in `applyGlobalBulletUpgrades` (Storm Needles, Scatter Gun, Rail Driver) but `min(0.25, stacks * 0.08)` in `createChargedBullets` (Pulse Cannon). Now `min(0.4, stacks * 0.06)` everywhere — slightly weaker per stack on Pulse Cannon at low stack counts, but the cap is now identical (0.4) and the per-stack rate matches across the roster.
  - **PIERCING** — `createChargedBullets` was overwriting `bullet.piercing = stacks`, while `applyGlobalBulletUpgrades` added to the existing piercing (`= (bullet.piercing||0) + stacks`). Now both are additive — consistent semantics.

---

## [5.40.14] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **MULTI_SHOT now carries over to every primary weapon, not just Pulse Cannon.** Previously only `firePulseCannon` (via `createChargedBullets`) consulted `MULTI_SHOT`; `fireStormNeedles`, `fireScatterGun`, and `fireRailDriver` ignored it entirely, firing exactly 1 bullet/pellet-spread/rail per shot regardless of stacks.
  - Storm Needles: now fires `1 + multiShotStacks` needles fanned across a small spread (≤0.5 rad).
  - Scatter Gun (pellet path): adds `multiShotStacks` to `pelletCount` on top of `BUCKSHOT`.
  - Scatter Gun (slug path): fires `1 + multiShotStacks` slugs in a tight fan (≤0.4 rad).
  - Rail Driver: fires `1 + multiShotStacks` rails in a narrow fan (≤0.3 rad — wider would feel chaotic at rail range).
  - Lance Beam: unchanged; multi-shot is a no-op for continuous-beam weapons.

### Note
- BIG_BULLETS already applies to all primary weapons via `applyGlobalBulletUpgrades`. Its effect on Storm Needles looks subtle because needles have a 0.5× base bullet size — at 1 stack you get `0.5 × 1.3 = 0.65×` of the base bullet radius. Stack BIG_BULLETS more times to see the visible growth.

---

## [5.40.13] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **KeyP debug powerup cheat: rewrote spawn logic to be uniform-random within the viewport** with two simple constraints — at least `MARGIN=80px` from the screen edges (so the powerup is fully visible) and at least `MIN_DIST=250px` from the player (so they actually have to fly to it). Rejection sampling: tries up to 20 random points and falls through with the last one if none satisfies the player-distance constraint. Replaces the previous edge-based selection logic.

---

## [5.40.12] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **KeyP debug powerup cheat: bumped inset from 40–80px to 140–220px** so powerups land solidly inside the play area instead of sliding behind HUD overlays / clipping at the visible boundary. The powerup's glow halo extends well beyond its 18px center radius, so a near-edge spawn looked off-screen even when technically inside. Also added a 200px corner padding along the chosen edge so powerups don't pile up in screen corners.

---

## [5.40.11] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **KeyP debug powerup cheat now spawns on-screen near a random edge** instead of off-screen. Picks a random edge (top/right/bottom/left), inset 40–80px so the powerup is fully visible, and converts to world coords via the camera offset. The previous off-screen behavior made it hard to verify quick-test scenarios because the powerup had to drift in before it became visible.

---

## [5.40.10] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Music player progress bar contrast tuned.** Unbuffered track background went from `rgba(255,255,255,0.2)` (moderately bright tint) to `rgba(0,0,0,0.75)` so the empty region reads as truly empty. Buffered ghost fill went from `rgba(255,255,255,0.28)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` so it sits clearly between the dark unbuffered region and the bright cyan playback fill.

---

## [5.40.9] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Buffered-load indicator on the music player progress bar.** A translucent ghost fill behind the playback fill shows how much of the current track has been downloaded. Driven by the audio element's `progress` event (fires while the browser fetches more data) reading `audio.buffered.end(last)` / `audio.duration`. New `MusicPlayer.onBufferedUpdate(fraction)` callback bound to a new `#music-player-buffered` div layered behind `#music-player-progress` via absolute positioning. Resets at track-change and re-emits a fresh reading immediately so a promoted-from-preload track that already has data shows it right away.

---

## [5.40.8] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Music player no longer auto-skips through every track after pressing Next/Prev/Random/Shuffle.** Regression introduced in 5.40.7: `_disposeAudio()` set `src=''` and called `load()` to cancel in-flight fetches, which fires an `error` event on the abandoned `<audio>`. The `error` listener installed earlier called `setTimeout(() => this.next(), 1000)` — so every track change scheduled a phantom `next()` from the disposed audio, fired 1s later, disposed that audio, scheduled another `next()`, and so on in a runaway loop. `_attachAudioListeners()` now stashes bound handlers on the element, `_disposeAudio()` removes them before clearing `src`, and the error handler short-circuits on a `_disposing` flag for belt-and-suspenders.

---

## [5.40.7] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Music player loading is now smarter about bandwidth.** Three concrete improvements to `MusicPlayer`:
  - **Dropped `prevAudio` entirely.** Backward navigation is rare; keeping a third Audio element alive cost ~1/3 of speculative bandwidth for almost no benefit. Pressing Previous now triggers a fresh fetch (acceptable tradeoff).
  - **Reuse the preloaded `nextAudio` instead of refetching.** `loadTrack()` now tracks `nextAudioIndex` and promotes the speculative preload to `currentAudio` when its index matches the requested one. Eliminates the redundant fetch that fired on every linear advance (Next button, auto-advance on track end).
  - **Skip preload after random jumps.** `playRandomTrack()` passes `{ skipPreload: true }` to `loadTrack()` so the player doesn't eagerly buffer `currentTrackIndex+1` after a non-linear jump — that buffer would just be discarded the next time the user hits random anyway. After shuffle, preload resumes normally (shuffled playback typically continues linearly through the new order).
  - Added `_disposeAudio(audio)` helper that actively cancels in-flight loads via `src=''; load()` rather than waiting for garbage collection. Also removed a duplicate `setVolume` definition.

---

## [5.40.6] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Shuffle button now scrolls the playlist back to the top** so the user sees the freshly-shuffled order from track 0 (the one that just started playing) instead of remaining wherever the previous scroll position was.

### Added
- **Instant custom tooltips on all six music player buttons** (shuffle / random / prev / play-pause / next / repeat). Replaced native `title` (which has a ~700ms browser-imposed delay) with `data-tooltip` + a CSS `:hover::after` pseudo-element that fires the moment the cursor enters the button. Includes a small arrow pointer pointing at the button for clear association.

---

## [5.40.5] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Shuffle button: highlighted playlist row now matches the actually-playing track.** The bug: `shuffleAndPlay()` reordered `musicPlayer.playlist` but only `populatePlaylist()` rebuilds the rendered DOM list. After shuffle the DOM still showed the *old* order, so toggling `.playing` on index 0 highlighted whatever happened to live there in the stale list while the audio played the new track 0. Result: highlighted track and playing track diverged.
- Added an `onPlaylistChange` callback on `MusicPlayer`; `shuffleAndPlay()` fires it after reordering. The UI binds it to `populatePlaylist()` so the rendered list is rebuilt before `loadTrack(0)` triggers `onTrackChange`. Highlight and audio are now always in consensus.

### Changed
- **Random button now scrolls the playlist to the picked track** via a new `scrollToCurrentTrack()` helper (`scrollIntoView({ block: 'center', behavior: 'smooth' })`). Without this, the player would silently start a track buried far down in the list with no visible indication of which one.

---

## [5.40.4] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Music player layout: shuffle + random grouped on the left, prev/play/next truly centered, repeat on the right.** Wrapped each side in a `.music-side-controls` div and switched `#music-controls` from `flex space-between` to `grid 1fr auto 1fr` so the center column stays centered regardless of how many buttons live in the side groups. Removed dead `.music-control-btn.left/.right` rules.

---

## [5.40.3] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Music player shuffle button now works on the first click.** The bug: `MusicPlayer.shufflePlaylist()` always set `isShuffled = true`, and the constructor calls it on init. So `isShuffled` was already `true` when the user first clicked, and `toggleShuffle()` flipped it to `false` — skipping the reshuffle entirely. Removed the flag mutation from `shufflePlaylist()`.

### Changed
- **Shuffle button is now an action, not a toggle.** Clicking it re-shuffles the playlist *and* loads + plays new track 0 — visible side effect (track changes, audio plays) confirms the action. New helper: `MusicPlayer.shuffleAndPlay()`.

### Added
- **Random-track button (🎲) in the music player.** Jumps to a uniformly random track and plays it without reordering the playlist (so prev/next still walks the existing order). New helper: `MusicPlayer.playRandomTrack()`. Bound to a new `#music-random` button placed next to the shuffle button. Both buttons briefly flash the `.active` class for visual feedback.

---

## [5.40.2] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Enemy bullets travel faster, especially in early waves.** `ENEMY_BULLET_CONFIG.BASE_SPEED_MULTIPLIER` raised from `0.85` → `1.05` so level-1 bullets fire at full declared speed rather than 85% of it. Per-level scaling already existed; bumped `LEVEL_SPEED_BONUS_PER_LEVEL` `0.08` → `0.10` and `MAX_LEVEL_SPEED_BONUS` `0.4` → `0.6` so the curve is steeper and tops out at +60% at level 7+ (was +40% at level 6+). Net effect: level-1 bullets are ~24% faster than before, late-game bullets ~41% faster. Existing per-pattern `SPEED_LIMITS` clamps remain unchanged and still accommodate the new range.

---

## [5.40.1] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Closing the shop now returns the player to whichever state they came from.** Previously the X button (and ESC) always routed `SHOP → PAUSED`, even if the player opened the shop mid-fight via the HUD shop button — which was disorienting (game suddenly paused with menu showing). Now `openShop()` captures `shopReturnState` before transitioning, and a new dispatcher `closeShopAndReturn()` routes:
  - opened from `PLAYING` (HUD shop button mid-fight) → resume gameplay via new `closeShopToPlaying()`
  - opened from `WAVE_TRANSITION` (auto-shop on wave complete) → `closeShop()` starts next wave (unchanged)
  - opened from `PAUSED` (pause-menu shop button) → `closeShopToPause()` returns to pause menu (unchanged)
- Wired through the DOM close button (`shop-dom.js`), the canvas-overlay close hit-region (`event-setup.js`), and the ESC handler (`game-engine.togglePause`).

---

## [5.39.16] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Asteroids hit harder by the early-wave easing pass — now 4–7 / 2–4 / 1–2 HP** (was 5–9 / 2–5 / 1–3). Big asteroids drop from 3.5–4.5s TTK to 2.0–3.5s with the starter Pulse Cannon. Small fragments now die in one or two hits, keeping wave clears snappy.
- **Enemy HP dialed back another ~15%** so players can build momentum and reach later waves faster: Hunter 6→5, Wasp 5→4, Weaver 6→5, Stalker 7→6, Drifter 8→7, Bomber 9→8, Sentinel 10→8, Guardian 12→10, Prowler 13→11, Titan 22→18. Trash mobs now die in 2.0–2.5s with starter weapon; mid-tier in 3.5–4.0s; Titan in 9s.

---

## [5.39.15] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **KeyP debug powerup cheat now spawns just beyond the viewport** instead of within ±50px of the player. Picks a random angle, places the powerup at half-diagonal + 40–120px so it drifts in from off-screen — better mimics organic spawn behavior for testing magnetism, blink, and the new expiry burst.

---

## [5.39.14] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Normalized ID3 title tags across all 68 music tracks to consistent Title Case.** Mix of all-lowercase and Title Case titles caused inconsistent display in the in-game playlist. Applies AP-style rules: capitalize first/last word and all major words; small English words (a/the/and/or/in/of/to/etc.) and Romance-language particles (de/la/el/du/le/etc.) stay lowercase mid-title. Apostrophes preserved (`don't` → `Don't`). Playlist regenerated from updated tags. Notable fixes: leading-space stripped from `" Solace de violencia"` → `Solace de Violencia`, `Not Here Nor There` → `Not Here nor There`.

### Added
- `tools/scripts/normalize-id3-tags.js` — idempotent script that reads, Title-Cases, and rewrites ID3 title tags. Re-run any time new tracks land with sloppy casing.

---

## [5.39.13] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Base enemy and asteroid HP cut by ~50% across the board** to fix early-wave slog. Per-level scaling unchanged (+20%/level enemies, +30%/level asteroids), so the early game eases dramatically while late waves stay ~half today's values — the player's DPS scales faster than the easing once weapons unlock and upgrades stack.
- **Enemies (was → new):** Hunter 12→6, Guardian 24→12, Wasp 11→5, Stalker 15→7, Drifter 17→8, Prowler 27→13, Weaver 12→6, Sentinel 21→10, Bomber 18→9, Titan 45→22.
- **Asteroids:** Big tier (40+r) 10–18→5–9, Medium (20–40r) 4–10→2–5, Small (5–20r) 2–5→1–3.
- TTK reference at level 1 with starter Pulse Cannon (2.0 DPS): Wasp 2.5s, Hunter 3.0s, Drifter 4.0s, Guardian 6.0s, Titan 11.0s, big asteroid 4.5s.

---

## [5.39.12] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Powerup lifetime tuned to 25s** (from the 8s testing value). Anchored to the 30s effect duration of most powerups — pickup window slightly shorter than the buff window so late pickups never waste effect time. Blink window narrowed to the last ~35% of life (~8.75s), enough warning to react without dominating the powerup's on-screen presence.

---

## [5.40.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **15 new music tracks** picked up by `tools/scripts/generate-playlist.js`: chiplight, chipper-to-meet-you, chipstrike, comet-coma, commander-chipknight, dark-lightning, deep-in-battle, jewel-of-light, lightning-step, lightning-strikes-twice, longia, not-here-nor-there, sip-of-life, target-found, tetrapyramid.

### Removed
- **10 Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio tracks removed** (aura, beyond-shadows, dangerous, inferno, iridium, legends, midnight, out-for-blood, salvation, world-eater) along with all README credits and the Music Credits section. Net library is now 68 tracks.

---

## [5.39.11] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Powerups burst into particles when their lifetime expires.** Previously they just vanished. Now `Powerup.update()` calls a new `emitExpiryBurst()` on life ≤ 0 that spawns a central `explosionFlash` (scaled to 2× radius), a colored `explosionRingColored` ring in the powerup's primary gradient color, 12 evenly-spaced `explosionShrapnel` streaks, and 8 `explosionEmber` lingerers in the secondary gradient color. `game-engine.js` now passes `particlePool` through the powerup update call so the entity can spawn its own expiry FX.

### Changed
- **Powerup lifetime drastically shortened (90s → 8s) and blink window widened (50% → 75% of lifetime) for testing visibility.** Restore via `this.life = 90 * GAME_CONFIG.LOGIC_HZ` and `this.fadeDuration = this.life / 2` once the new burst+blink combo is dialed in.

---

## [5.39.10] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Powerup wind-down switched from opacity fade to ramping blink.** Removed all `fadeAlpha` multipliers from the draw — body, glow sprite, sparkles, and label all render at full opacity. During the fade window (last half of lifetime) the entire `draw()` early-returns on "off" frames driven by `Math.sin((frameClock.now / 1000) * hz * 2π) < 0`. Blink rate ramps from ~1.5Hz at the start of the window to ~14Hz right before expiry, so the powerup blinks lazily at first then strobes urgently — communicating "running out" without depending on globalAlpha at all.

---

## [5.39.9] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Powerup fade is now actually gradual.** `fadeDuration` was 8s of LOGIC_HZ ticks (~16s real), about 9% of a powerup's ~180s lifetime — so they sat at full opacity for the vast majority of life and only faded in a brief tail. Now `fadeDuration = maxLife / 2`: the last half of the lifetime is a smooth linear fade from full to zero. Sprite caching (`glowSpriteCache`) was suspected as the cause — it isn't; `ctx.globalAlpha` multiplies through `drawImage` of cached canvases correctly. The visible "snap" was simply the fade window being too small relative to lifetime.

---

## [5.39.8] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Powerups now actually fade out instead of popping off.** The pre-rendered glow sprite (`glowSpriteCache.draw`) sets `ctx.globalAlpha` internally, which clobbered the `fadeAlpha` set just before it — so the body, hexagon/star/etc. shape, and icon all rendered at constant `0.6` alpha for the entire lifetime, then disappeared instantly when `life ≤ 0`. Only the sparkle ring and name label faded (they re-set `globalAlpha` later in the draw). Now the glow's alpha is multiplied by `fadeAlpha`, and `globalAlpha` is re-applied as `fadeAlpha` afterward so the entire pickup participates in the fade.
- **Fade curve switched from sqrt to linear.** The previous `sqrt(life/fadeDuration)` curve held alpha high for most of the fade window then dropped sharply in the last ~1s — perceptually still a "snap." Linear gives an even, gradual decay across the full 16s fade tail.

---

## [5.39.7] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Debug `P` powerup spawn now drops just beyond the viewport.** Previously dropped within ±50px of the player (visible pop-in). Now spawns at a random angle at `viewport-diagonal/2 + 40–120px` from the player so the pickup drifts in from off-screen.

---

## [5.39.6] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Player friction increased again — even faster stop.** Friction baseline `0.70 → 0.50` (per-frame @60Hz: `0.837 → 0.707`). Coasting halflife drops from `~65ms → ~33ms`; full decay to the 0.05 snap-threshold goes from ~24 frames (~400ms) to ~13 frames (~217ms). Top speed is preserved — with `thrustPower 2.0`, velocity now asymptotes at ~3.41 (still 97% of the 3.5 `MAX_V` cap), so peak feel is unchanged but stops are noticeably crisper.

---

## [5.39.5] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Player movement: momentum minimized further — now near-instant.** Pushed both knobs harder so the ship stops the frame after release and reaches top speed in a few frames:
  - `thrustPower`: `0.38 → 2.0` (per-frame delta @60Hz: `0.19 → 1.0`).
  - Friction at 30Hz baseline: `0.97 → 0.70` (per-frame @60Hz: `0.985 → 0.837`).
  - Coasting halflife @60Hz: `~450ms → ~65ms` (~7× tighter than before this version, ~30× tighter than the original `0.988` floaty feel).
  - Time to reach `MAX_V` cap: `~14 frames (235ms) → ~5 frames (80ms)`.
  - Direction reversal time at full speed: roughly `30+ frames → 4–5 frames`.
  - Top-speed cap (`MAX_V`) and snap-to-zero threshold (`0.05`) unchanged. Net feel: arrow key in = move; arrow key out = stop. Almost no glide.

---

## [5.39.4] - 2026-04-30

### Removed
- **Music player marquee effect removed.** The scrolling marquee on the now-playing track name and on overflowing playlist entries (both the auto-scroll for the active row and the hover-scroll for the others) is gone. Track titles now render as static text. Playback, progress bar, time display, playlist selection, and the ♪ indicator on the active row are all preserved. Removed code paths: `ensureMarquee`, `applyPlaylistMarquee`, `checkPlaylistMarquees`, `addPlaylistTrackHoverEffects`, the `.marquee-text` / `.marquee-container` markup, the `.has-marquee` CSS, and all `_marqueeRAF` / `_marqueeChecked` bookkeeping.

## [5.39.3] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Player controls tightened — less floaty, more instant.** Two coordinated tweaks so the ship stops and turns where the player tells it to, without losing the top-speed feel:
  - `thrustPower`: `0.18 → 0.38` (more acceleration → reaches top speed faster on key-press, so taps register immediately instead of as a slow ramp).
  - Friction at 30Hz baseline: `0.988 → 0.97` (much more drag → velocity decays in ~0.77s halflife instead of ~1.9s, so coasting is roughly 2.5× shorter when keys release).
  - Net effect: controls feel one-to-one — press a direction, the ship moves; release, the ship stops quickly. Top speed (`MAX_V` cap) and direction-change behavior are unchanged. The snap-to-zero threshold was deliberately left at `0.05`: at 60Hz the `TICK_SCALE` factor shrinks the per-frame thrust delta to ~0.19, so a larger threshold would clamp acceleration to zero every frame and freeze the ship.

---

## [5.39.2] - 2026-04-30

### Removed
- **CRT scanline overlay.** The `#scanline-overlay` div + its `linear-gradient` 4px stripe + 10s scanline animation are gone. Borrowed from the pixel-art arcade aesthetic, the overlay didn't suit Rainboids' glow-heavy vector visuals — it muted the brightness on every other row (25%-dark stripe at 4px pitch), reduced HUD legibility for the small enemy-header and damage-number text, and ran at z-index 500 over the whole viewport every frame. Removed the div from `index.html`, the `#scanline-overlay` rule and `@keyframes scanline` from `styles.css`. May reintroduce as an optional Controls/SFX toggle later if desired.

---

## [5.39.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Top-of-screen target HP readout enlarged.** The "X / Y" HP numbers under the enemy health bar bumped from 12px → 16px so they read at a glance. `numberY` recomputed as `barY + barHeight + 14` so the larger glyphs sit ~14px below the bar bottom.
- **Whole `LV.N  ENEMY` row now centered as a single block.** Previously the name was centered on screen and the LV.N tag hung off its left edge, which pushed the visual mass off-center to the right. Now the renderer measures the full `LV. + level number + gap + name` width once and places the entire row so the block (not just the name) is centered. All three glyphs still bottom-align to the name's baseline.

---

## [5.39.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **HELP tab in shop, now the landing tab.** Explains the three resources and the upgrade flow before the player browses items. Three entries:
  - **GOLD** — dropped by destroyed enemies and asteroids, picks up automatically; spend on OFFENSE / PRIMARY / POWER (gold-priced).
  - **SKILL POINTS (SP)** — awarded on level-up; spend on DEFENSE / DROPS / SKILLS (SP-priced).
  - **EXPERIENCE (XP)** — awarded for every hit you land; tracked by the red bar under the health bar; filling it grants a level + 1 SP.
  Lives in `shop-dom.js` `buildHelpPanel()`; styled by `.shop-help-*` rules. New `data-tab="HELP"` button uses neutral silver tab color matching the controls tab convention.
- **HUD SHOP button (top-right, next to pause).** New `#hud-shop-btn` element matches the goldenrod styling/dim-until-hover pattern of `#hud-pause-btn`. Click opens the shop overlay directly during play — `gameEngine.openShop()` on click. Hidden during title screen and while shop is already open. New `ui:show-hud-shop-btn` / `ui:hide-hud-shop-btn` events route through `uiManager.showHudShopBtn()` / `hideHudShopBtn()`.

### Changed
- **Shop auto-opens after every wave clears.** Previously the wave-complete countdown counted to zero and started the next wave automatically. Now the countdown is removed: 700ms after the "WAVE COMPLETE!" toast registers, the shop pops up. The player browses for as long as they want and the next wave only starts when they close the shop (`closeShop()` already calls `startNextWave()`). Combined with the HELP tab as the landing page, this turns each between-wave moment into a roguelite progression beat — earn loot during the wave, spend it before the next.
- **Shop tab grid widened to 4 columns** (`repeat(3, …)` → `repeat(4, …)`) to fit the new HELP tab. Layout: row 1 = HELP / OFFENSE / PRIMARY / POWER; row 2 = DEFENSE / DROPS / SKILLS. Strip width capped at `min(960px, 100%)` so cells don't stretch on ultrawide screens.

---

## [5.38.7] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Pulse Cannon now respects `config.range` like every other primary.** `createChargedBullets` (the path used by Pulse Cannon and the Charge Shot power weapon) was hard-coding range from `Math.max(1, speedMultiplier * 0.5)` and never reading the weapon's `config.range`. Added an optional `rangeOverride` parameter (default `1`, so Charge Shot is unchanged) that gets multiplied into both `bullet.rangeMultiplier` and `bullet.maxLife` — same formula the other weapons use. `firePulseCannon` now passes `config.range`. The range pipeline is finally consistent across all 5 primaries: change one number in `weapon-data.js` to retune any weapon's reach.
- **Re-tuned ranges to keep ~240px on-screen travel** now that Pulse Cannon respects R:
  - PULSE_CANNON: `1.5 → 1.0` (was unused before; effective travel unchanged at ~240px)
  - STORM_NEEDLES: `1.0` (unchanged)
  - SCATTER_GUN: `1.0` (unchanged)
  - RAIL_DRIVER: `0.7 → 0.85` (5.38.6 over-shortened this; the math is quadratic in R, so 0.7 → 165px not 240px. 0.85² × 11.2 × 30 ≈ 240px ✓)
  - LANCE_BEAM: `0.6` (unchanged — raycast `R × 400 = 240px`)

---

## [5.38.6] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Non-Pulse-Cannon primaries traveled past the screen edge.** 5.38.5 set every primary to `range: 1.5`, but `firePulseCannon` calls `createChargedBullets` which **does not read `config.range`** (line 876 in `player/weapons.js`) — it uses the bullet's default `maxLife` (~30 frames × default speed ≈ 240px). The other weapons (Storm Needles, Scatter Gun, Rail Driver, Lance Beam) DO multiply `bullet.maxLife * config.range`, so they were flying ~360–600px while Pulse Cannon stayed at ~240px. Re-tuned each weapon's `config.range` so its effective on-screen travel matches Pulse Cannon:
  - STORM_NEEDLES: `1.5 → 1.0` (45 → 30 frames × 8 px ≈ 240px)
  - SCATTER_GUN: `1.5 → 1.0` (~240px)
  - RAIL_DRIVER: `1.5 → 0.7` — compensates for its `bulletSpeed: 1.4` velocity boost (`8 × 1.4 × 21 ≈ 240px`)
  - LANCE_BEAM: `1.5 → 0.6` (raycast distance `0.6 × 400 = 240px`)
  - PULSE_CANNON: `1.5` (unchanged — value is unused but kept as documentation)
- Range upgrades (LONG_RANGE / PENETRATOR / VELOCITY) still multiply on top, so investing in them remains the path to longer reach.

---

## [5.38.5] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **All primary weapons now share the same base range (1.5).** Followed up the 5.38.4 range bump by flattening Storm Needles (1.4 → 1.5), Scatter Gun (1.2 → 1.5), Lance Beam (1.6 → 1.5), and Rail Driver (1.8 → 1.5) to match Pulse Cannon. No primary out-ranges another at base; differentiation now comes from fire rate, damage, spread, piercing, and per-weapon range upgrades (LONG_RANGE / PENETRATOR / VELOCITY) rather than baseline reach.

---

## [5.38.4] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Base range increased on all 5 primary weapons** so every weapon can engage threats at roughly half-screen to three-quarter-screen distance before bullets expire. `config.range = 1.0` ≈ 460px ≈ ~43% of typical screen height (1080px), so the new band ≈ 0.5–0.75 of screen height. Relative ordering preserved (Scatter shortest, Rail longest); LONG_RANGE / PENETRATOR / VELOCITY upgrades still multiply on top.
  - PULSE_CANNON: `0.85 → 1.5` (~65% of screen height)
  - STORM_NEEDLES: `0.7 → 1.4` (~60%)
  - SCATTER_GUN: `0.5 → 1.2` (~52%)
  - LANCE_BEAM: `1.2 → 1.6` (~69%)
  - RAIL_DRIVER: `1.5 → 1.8` (~77%)

---

## [5.38.3] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Shop tabs grouped by currency.** Reorganized into two rows: row 1 holds the three gold-priced tabs (OFFENSE / PRIMARY / POWER), row 2 holds the three SP-priced tabs (DEFENSE / DROPS / SKILLS). Switched `.shop-tabs` grid from `repeat(4, …)` (4 + 2 layout) to `repeat(3, …)` so each currency group fills its own row, making "what does this cost" obvious at a glance from the tab strip alone.

---

## [5.38.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Shop now uses the HUD's coin-stack icon instead of the 💰 emoji.** The HUD renders a stylized coin-stack icon via `drawCachedMoneyIcon` (path data in `core/utils.js`); the shop was using the generic Unicode money-bag emoji, so the two read as different currencies at a glance. Inlined the same SVG path in `shop-dom.js` as `COIN_SVG_PATH` and added a `makeCoinIconSvg(size)` helper. The currency header now swaps in a 20px SVG, and every item-row coin price uses `makeCoinPrice(amount)` (16px SVG + cost number) instead of `'💰 ${cost}'` text. Visually consistent across HUD and shop with no canvas hop — pure SVG scales crisply at any size.

---

## [5.38.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Shop overlay was being dimmed to 25% by its own HUD-dimming rule.** The new `#shop-overlay` carries class `ui-element` (so it inherits the shared HUD z-index / font setup), but `body.shop-open .ui-element { opacity: 0.25 }` — which is meant to dim the score, lives, and other HUD chrome behind the shop — also matched the shop overlay itself, making the whole panel translucent. Narrowed the selector to `body.shop-open .ui-element:not(#shop-overlay)` so the shop renders at full opacity.

---

## [5.38.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Shop UI converted from canvas rendering to HTML overlay.** The shop now mirrors the pause-menu pattern: a fullscreen `#shop-overlay` containing `#shop-menu` with a header (close X, title, currency display), a 4-column tab strip, and a scrollable item list — all DOM, all styled via CSS. Tabs are real `<button class="shop-tab" data-tab="…">` elements; items are `<button class="shop-item">` elements with nested icon/body/cost/sell sub-elements. Per-tab category colors mirror the canvas palette via `data-tab[…]` selectors with `--tab-color` custom properties. Clicks, hover effects, and scrolling are now native DOM behaviors instead of canvas hit-testing — no more `shopTabBounds` / `shopItemBounds` / `shopScrollbarBounds` / `shopScrollThumbDrag` ad-hoc state. Item state classes (`--equipped`, `--owned`, `--maxed`, `--cant-afford`) drive all visual styling. Files added: `js/modules/shop/shop-dom.js` (renderer + event delegation). The legacy `js/modules/shop/shop-renderer.js` is no longer called from the draw loop — `drawShop()` is replaced with a comment pointing at the DOM module.
- **Shop tabs now use the same boilerplate as pause-menu tabs.** Both menus share the 4-column grid, 18px font, color-mix hover/active patterns, and `data-tab[…]` per-tab color hooks, just under separate selectors (`.pause-tab` vs `.shop-tab`). Items reuse the same row-card visual language as the pause menu's primary/power weapon lists.

### Fixed
- **`drawShop` no longer runs once per frame while the shop is open.** Frees up the canvas frame budget — every gradient, hit-test array, and scroll-thumb computation that used to render every tick is now zero. The shop is fully responsive HTML.

---

## [5.37.10] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Shop tabs reflowed to 4-per-row to match pause-menu width.** `tabsPerRow` 3 → 4, so the 6 shop tabs lay out as **4 + 2** rows instead of **3 + 3**, giving each tab a narrower cell that matches the pause-menu strip. Tab colors / fonts / heights unchanged.
- **Pause-menu tabs gained per-category colors mirroring the shop palette.** The 7 pause tabs no longer share a single white border. Each tab now uses a CSS custom property `--tab-color` driven by its `data-tab` attribute, with hover/active states tinting the background and border via `color-mix`. Width stays the 4-column grid from 5.37.8. Color assignments:
  - `controls` — neutral silver `#cccccc`
  - `primary` — shop cyan `#00ccff`
  - `power` — shop red `#ff4444`
  - `skills` — shop purple `#aa66ff`
  - `powerups` — shop gold `#ffd700`
  - `music` — shop green `#44dd88`
  - `sfx` — orange `#ffa500`

---

## [5.37.9] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Shop tab labels enlarged.** Tab font bumped from 14px → 18px (matching the pause-menu tab size set in 5.37.8); tab cell height grew 36 → 44 to keep proportional padding around the bigger glyphs. The 3 × 2 grid layout from 5.37.7 is unchanged — `drawShopTabs` still returns the strip's full height so the scrollable item region below adjusts automatically.

---

## [5.37.8] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Pause-menu tab strip enlarged and reflowed to a 4×2 grid.** The 7 pause-menu tabs (CONTROLS / PRIMARY / POWER / SKILLS / POWERUPS / MUSIC / SFX) used to ride a single flex row with 14px labels, which crammed them into a thin strip on wide screens. Switched `.pause-tabs` from `flex` to `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, minmax(0, 1fr))` so the tabs always wrap to two rows (4 + 3 layout), capped the strip at `min(720px, 100%)` and centered it. `.pause-tab` font bumped 14px → 18px, padding 9px/14px → 14px/18px, with `white-space: nowrap` and `text-align: center` so the labels stay tidy in their grid cells.

---

## [5.37.7] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Shop category tabs reflowed to 3 × 2 grid with bigger labels.** The 6 shop tabs (OFFENSE, DEFENSE, DROPS, PRIMARY, POWER, SKILLS) used to be crammed into a single row at 28px tall with 10px font, which left each tab narrow and the labels small. Now: two rows × three columns, 36px tall per row, 14px label font (was 10px), 6px row gap. `drawShopTabs` returns the full tab-strip height so the scrollable item region below adjusts automatically — no more hard-coded `tabsY + 40`. Click hit-testing tracks each tab's per-row Y, so all 6 tabs remain clickable in their new positions.

---

## [5.37.6] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Shop SKILLS tab showed a gold-coin icon for items priced in SP.** Skills set `isSkill: true` and `currency: 'SP'`, but the row renderer in `shop-renderer.js` lumped them into the same `isWeaponOrSkill` branch as primary/power weapons. That branch always slapped a gold-coin icon next to `actualCost`, treating the SP cost as if it were coins. Added an explicit `item.currency === 'SP'` sub-branch ahead of the dual-cost path: for SP-only items it now renders a single blue "X SP" line (color matches the existing canAfford logic), no gold-coin icon. The dual-cost rendering is preserved for weapons that genuinely mix coins + SP.

---

## [5.37.5] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Destruction flash refined — present and obvious, no longer in-your-face.** Three coordinated changes so kills still feel weighty without washing the screen white:
  - **Particle alpha cap** (`world/particle.js` `explosionFlash` draw): peak `globalAlpha` reduced from 0.9 → 0.55, life curve switched from linear to `pow(life, 1.5)` so the flash eases out instead of sitting at peak. Inner gradient stops softened (center 1.0 → 0.85, mid 0.7 → 0.45, fringe 0.2 → 0.12).
  - **Spawn radius** scaled back: asteroid `baseRadius * 2.2` → `baseRadius * 1.5`; enemy `radius * 3.0` → `radius * 2.0`. The flash still reaches well past the silhouette but no longer dominates the screen.
  - **Screen flash overlay** (`triggerScreenFlash` strength): asteroid small `0.07 → 0.035`, asteroid large `0.12 → 0.06`, enemy `0.15 → 0.07`. Roughly halved across the board.

---

## [5.37.4] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Destroyed enemies now scatter full-silhouette debris like asteroids do.** `createShapeDebris` previously emitted only 6 short stubs (each ≤ `radius * 0.5` long), so enemy explosions felt visually empty next to asteroid kills which throw 30 wireframe edge segments outward. Replaced with a per-type vertex list that traces the actual hull outline at full radius plus a few internal struts/spokes, then emits one debris segment per consecutive outline pair plus all struts via the existing `lineDebrisPool`. Counts by type:
  - HUNTER (triangle-ish ship): 4 outline + 2 hull braces = 6 segments
  - GUARDIAN (square): 4 outline + 2 diagonals = 6
  - WASP (diamond): 4 outline + 2 cross braces = 6
  - TITAN / TANGERINE (8-sided): 8 outline + 8 inner ring + 4 spokes = 20
  - STALKER (plus/cross): 12 outline + 2 cross braces = 14
  - All others (DRIFTER / PROWLER / WEAVER / SENTINEL): 6 outline + 6 inner-ring struts = 12
- Each segment uses the enemy's color and inherits the existing `LineDebris` physics/fade. The existing per-frame asteroid debris debris-vs-fade behavior is unchanged.

---

## [5.37.3] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Powerup body gradients now cached per color pair.** The previous draw built **two fresh `createRadialGradient` objects every frame for every onscreen powerup** (outer aura + body fill). Each call allocates a CanvasGradient and uploads its color stops to the GPU, so with 3–6 powerups onscreen this was 6–12 gradient allocations per frame just for pickups. Replaced with a module-level `Map` keyed on `gradientColors[0]+'|'+gradientColors[1]` — there are 19 powerup types, so the cache fills once and stays small. The pulse-scaling effect (`pulse` oscillates 0.7→1.0) is now applied via `ctx.scale(pulse, pulse)` so the cached gradient and the body path stay in sync without rebuilding the gradient at the new radius. Side benefit: the icon font string (`bold ${currentRadius * 0.8}px Arial`) is no longer reallocated per frame either — `POWERUP_ICON_FONT` is a module constant since the unscaled radius is fixed at 18. Net: zero per-frame gradient/string allocations in the powerup draw path.

---

## [5.37.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Render perf quick wins.** Six low-risk hot-path edits surfaced by a rendering audit:
  - `powerup.js`: `Date.now()` → `frameClock.now` (the cached per-frame timestamp), and dropped `shadowBlur=3/shadowColor='#000000'` on the icon — the existing stroked-black outline already provides legibility, and `shadowBlur` runs a Gaussian pass per glyph.
  - `asteroid.js` `drawTargetingEffect` and `enemy/shapes.js` targeting effect: replaced live `shadowBlur` on stroked rings (one of the slowest canvas patterns) with a fake-glow trick — a wider, fainter ring underneath plus a sharp ring on top. Visually equivalent, no Gaussian pass.
  - `enemy-bullet.js`: dropped `shadowBlur=4` on the BOMB label; replaced with `strokeText` (a black outline pass), which is far cheaper.
  - `world/particle.js`: hoisted the damage-number font string into a module-level `DAMAGE_NUMBER_FONT` constant so the template literal isn't reallocated once per particle per frame.

These don't change visuals meaningfully but eliminate repeated Gaussian-blur work on every frame for any active targeting reticle, every onscreen powerup, and every onscreen bomb projectile.

---

## [5.37.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Powerups dropped by enemies now last a long time and fade out gracefully.** The Powerup class set `this.life = 20s` in `reset()` but `update()` never decremented it, so the surrounding code claimed "powerups never despawn." In practice players reported them disappearing — most likely from off-screen wraps making them hard to find. Replaced the dead `life` field with a real explicit lifetime: 90s of full visibility, then a smooth `sqrt`-eased fade over the final 8s, then released by the pool's normal `cleanupInactive` sweep. The fade alpha is multiplied into every existing `globalAlpha` override (body, sparkle ring, label) so all visuals dim together rather than the body vanishing while the label hangs in the air.

---

## [5.37.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Ramming is no longer a viable strategy against asteroids or enemy ships.** Previously the player dealt 25 damage to asteroids (10–18 HP → instant kill) and 50 damage to enemies on contact, so flying head-first into things was a faster, safer "weapon" than actually shooting. Now contact does only a 2-damage scrape to asteroids and 5 damage to enemies — enough to finish a near-dead target but never enough to make ramming the optimal play.
- **Stronger collision deflection.** To match, the player now gets launched off whatever it hits. `ASTEROID_KNOCKBACK_MULTIPLIER` 12.0 → 22.0, `BOUNCE_FORCE_MULTIPLIER` 6.0 → 12.0, `BOUNCE_RESTITUTION` 0.8 → 0.9, `OVERLAP_PUSH_FORCE` 2.0 → 5.0, `SEPARATION_BUFFER` 5 → 6. Combined with the lower contact damage, the player is now shoved decisively away from the surface instead of being able to sit inside the hitbox grinding it down.
- **Asteroid hit-spark embers fade more gracefully.** The soft circular glowing dots that linger when a bullet strikes an asteroid (`explosionEmber`) now fade with a `pow(life, 0.55)` curve so they hold their brightness through most of the lifetime and ease out gently at the tail instead of dimming linearly. Lifetime stretched ~67% (decay 0.015 → 0.009/frame, roughly 1.1–1.8s → 1.8–3.0s) so they feel like cooling embers rather than flickering out. Both the inner dot and the additive `screen`-composited halo follow the same curve. (The line-debris segments from destroyed asteroids are unchanged — an earlier experiment with shadowBlur there hurt perf and was reverted.)

---

## [5.36.3] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Target HP header now uses three distinct font sizes.** Previously `LV.` and the level number shared one font size (22px) and the name was 16px. Split into three independent sizes, each bottom-aligned with the name baseline so the row reads cleanly: `LV.` label at 12px (blue `#5DA9FF`, smallest), level number at 18px (red `#E74057`, middle), enemy name at 22px (gold `#FFD700`, largest). Each piece is measured at its own font size before layout so the LV block stays flush to the name's left edge regardless of digit count.

---

## [5.36.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Top-of-screen target HP display rebalanced.** The `LV.N` indicator and the enemy name swapped visual weight: level font bumped from 14px → 22px so it reads at a glance, enemy name dropped from 22px → 16px so it no longer dominates the row. Existing bottom-alignment math keeps the (now larger) LV block flush with the (now smaller) name's baseline, and the health bar slides up the few pixels naturally — no manual layout tweaks needed.

---

## [5.36.1] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Pause-menu controls list font enlarged.** Each control row in the CONTROLS tab now uses 1.25rem with 1.4 line-height (was inheriting the smaller default), and the boxed `.control-symbol` chips bumped from 1.5rem to 1.75rem so labels like `WASD` / `LEFT-CLICK` read clearly. Row spacing nudged from 6px to 10px to keep the list breathing at the larger size.

---

## [5.36.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Asteroid hit flash now propagates as a wave across every edge.** Previously the damage flash filled the entire dodecahedron silhouette uniformly white for the duration of the timer — every face lit at once, no spatial cue from where the bullet struck. Replaced with a per-edge propagation: each edge's brightness follows a Gaussian centered on a wavefront that expands outward from the world-space impact point, so the lattice lights up in a ring that sweeps across all 30 edges of the dodecahedron over the 10-frame window. Edge midpoint distance is normalized by the asteroid's diameter, the wave moves 0→1.1 over the flash duration, and intensity below 2% is culled. The localized hit-point glow, expanding ring, and directional debris remain unchanged.

---

## [5.35.2] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Charge Shot kept charging past full.** `updateChargingSystem` clamped the visual `chargeLevel` to 1.0 and toggled `isFullyCharged` once the configured max was reached, but `fireChargedShot` then read the *raw* unclamped elapsed-time value when computing size, speed, damage bonus, and crit-chance bonus — so holding the fire button past the max charge window kept making the shot bigger and stronger forever, despite the HUD showing "fully charged." Fixed by clamping `chargeTime` to `reducedMaxChargeTime` before the multiplier math in `fireChargedShot`, so all derived values cap at the intended ceiling (~3 damage / +20% crit / 3× size at 5s default).

---

## [5.35.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Asteroid fragments visibly "jumped" apart on split.** Three things conspired: (1) fragment trajectories were assigned random angles, so two siblings could end up flying nearly the same direction and stay overlapping; (2) spawn used a `±20% of radius` positional jitter that pre-scattered fragments in an artificial-feeling way; (3) the 750ms collision-immunity window sometimes expired while fragments were still overlapping, at which point the asteroid-vs-asteroid collision system applied its positional `overlap` displacement and teleported them apart in one frame. Fixed by distributing fragment angles evenly around 360° (with ±25% slice-width jitter for organic feel — guarantees every pair diverges), spawning at the parent's exact center (velocity does all the separation, no artificial scatter), and bumping the immunity window to 2500ms so even the slowest-separating pair has cleared overlap before collisions kick in. Verified with a probe: fragments now separate monotonically (~85px/sec gap growth) and are 90px clear of overlap by the time immunity expires.

---

## [5.35.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- **Every SFX redesigned for richness and futuristic character.** All 26 sounds in `sound-defs.js` are now multi-layer (most 3 layers, a few 2) — including the basic `shoot` / `hit` / `coin` / `explosion` / `playerExplosion` ones that previously rode bare sfxr presets. Common sonic vocabulary across the library:
  - **Sub-bass body** (sine / low square): adds weight and "felt" impact under every hit.
  - **Mid-impact carrier** (square, often duty-modulated): the recognizable note of the sound.
  - **High HPF'd transient or arpeggiated tail**: brightness, sparkle, tech sheen.
  - **Sweeps + arp_mod + vibrato**: most layers move in pitch (descending energy bursts, rising chimes, warbling beams) instead of staying static.
- **Specific upgrades**:
  - `shoot`: square pew with downward sweep + sub-bass thump + HPF brightness flash. Replaces the bare `laserShoot` preset.
  - `hit`: synthetic kinetic slap with arp + HPF noise transient (was bare `hitHurt` preset).
  - `coin`: 3-tone crystalline tinkle — sine root with rising sweep + square harmonic with vibrato + HPF arpeggio sparkle (was bare `pickupCoin`).
  - `explosion` / `playerExplosion`: sub-bass boom + LPF noise body + HPF crackle. `playerExplosion` adds a sawtooth power-down whine for the cataclysmic feel.
  - `tractorBeam`: square hum + sine harmonic, both with vibrato — sustained energy field instead of a static drone.
  - `shield`: noise wash + crystal sine ping with rising sweep — force-field bloom.
  - `healthRegen`: warm LPF'd sawtooth + healing sine harmonic with arp.
  - `playerHitAsteroid`: noise punch + sub-bass rumble + metallic ring layer.
  - `playerHitEnemy`: square clang + sub-impact + bright HPF alarm pip.
  - All `enemyHit_*` and `playerHit_*` sounds gained a 3rd layer (where appropriate) — high HPF transients on small hits, sub-bass impacts on heavy hits, arpeggiated tails on energy weapons.
- **Library size**: 26 files / 620 KB → 26 files / 904 KB (still tiny). File counts unchanged — same 26 sounds, just denser per file.

---

## [5.34.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **SFX library redesigned with multi-layer SFXR compositions.** sfxr is monophonic — one wave, one envelope per voice — so the previous library felt thin. The generator now supports a `{ layers: [...] }` def shape: each layer is a separate sfxr render summed sample-wise into one WAV, then peak-normalized to 0.95. The result is a single playable WAV that carries body + impact + sparkle. Highlights:
  - **`powerup`**: 3-layer ascending chime — sine bell with rising arpeggio + square shimmer with vibrato + high HPF'd twinkle tail. Reads as a chord, not a synth voice.
  - **`playerHitAsteroid`** (player ship rams asteroid): noise punch + sub-bass sine rumble.
  - **`playerHitEnemy`** (player ship rams enemy): square clang with downward arp + bright HPF'd alarm pip.
  - **`playerHit_*`** (per-weapon bullet→enemy/asteroid): each weapon now has weight appropriate to its damage profile — PULSE_CANNON gets a punchy plasma blast over a low warm body; STORM_NEEDLES stays a thin tick (one voice — it's a fast SFX); SCATTER_GUN gets a noise-crunch over low body; RAIL_DRIVER gets a heavy arp'd clang with sub-bass; LANCE_BEAM gets a saw fizz with a high zap.
  - **`enemyHit_*`** (per-pattern bullet→player): hunter gets a clean kinetic ping; guardian a warm chord; missile a deep boom + ringing tail; arc_lightning a noise crackle + zap pip; lay_mine a bassy thud + ring; etc. Each pattern is sonically distinct so the player learns to read incoming threats by ear.
- **Generator output simplified to one WAV per sound.** No more 10-variant directories. `sfx/<name>.wav` lives at the manifest root; manifest is `{ sounds: { name: 'sfx/name.wav' } }`. Library shrank from 260 files / 2.7 MB to 26 files / 620 KB.
- **Generator emits 16-bit PCM at 44.1 kHz.** Previous output rode jsfxr's 8-bit WAV encoder; layered mixing needs floating-point intermediate samples and 16-bit gives the headroom to encode the mix without quantization audible on the bass layers.

### Removed
- **Re-roll feature.** With one curated WAV per sound, the per-sound 🎲 button and the "REROLL ALL" button serve no purpose. Removed:
  - `audioManager.rerollSound(name)` and `audioManager.rerollAllSounds()`
  - The per-sound reroll button in `createSfxToggles()`
  - `setupRerollAllButton()` and the `#reroll-all-sfx` element reference
  - The "🎲 REROLL ALL" button div in `index.html`
  - `.sfx-reroll-button` styles in `styles.css`
- **Variant tracking** in `AudioManager` (`activeVariant` map, `_loadRandomVariant`) — replaced with a single decode pass over the manifest URLs.

---

## [5.33.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **SFX pipeline replaced with pre-rendered WAV library.** Sounds were previously synthesized live via the SFXR CDN bundle (`sfxr.toWebAudio(params, ctx)` rendering an AudioBuffer at init from a JS params object). Now `tools/scripts/generate-sfx.js` runs offline, generating 10 distinct variants per sound (260 WAVs total under `sfx/<name>/<NN>.wav`) plus a `sfx/manifest.json` that maps sound name → variant URLs. At game load, `AudioManager.init()` fetches the manifest, picks one random variant per sound, and decodes it into an `AudioBuffer` via `decodeAudioData`. `playSound()` is back to its simplest form — `createBufferSource` + `GainNode` + `start(0)` — with no scheduling cursor, no per-sound throttle, no decode-on-the-fly. Removes the runtime dependency on the sfxr CDN scripts (`https://sfxr.me/{riffwave,sfxr}.js` no longer loaded).

### Added
- **`sfx/` directory** holding 260 pre-rendered SFX variants (~2.7 MB). Regenerable any time via `npm run generate-sfx` (`--clean` to wipe first, `--variants=N` to change the count).
- **`js/modules/audio/sound-defs.js`** — single source of truth for SFX. Each entry is either `{ preset: 'laserShoot', overrides? }` (re-rolled per variant via `sfxr.generate`) or `{ params: {...}, jitter? }` (mutated per variant via `jitterParams`). Both the offline generator and the runtime import this module.
- **Per-sound re-roll wired through to swap variants live.** The pause menu's SFX tab `🎲` button calls `audioManager.rerollSound(name)`, which picks a different variant from the manifest, fetches+decodes it, and replaces the cached buffer. Subsequent `playSound(name)` calls use the new variant.
- **`npm run generate-sfx`** script.

### Removed
- Inline `sfxr.generate(...)` and custom params object inside `audio-manager.js` constructor — moved to `sound-defs.js`.
- Sfxr-readiness wait + 5s timeout in `main.js` `setupAudio()` — no longer needed (no global `sfxr` dependency at runtime).
- `audioCursor` / `beginLogicTick` cross-tick spreading and per-sound `nextPlayTime` throttle (introduced in 5.32.4–5.32.5, neutralized in 5.32.6) — fully removed; `beginLogicTick` retained as a no-op for engine call-site compatibility.
- The complex `rerollSound` switch statement that had per-sound regeneration logic in code — replaced with a one-liner that picks a different variant URL from the manifest.

---

## [5.32.6] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Collision SFX silently dropped after the v5.32.5 per-sound throttle.** The throttle was scheduled to drop repeats of the same sound name when `nextPlayTime` queued more than 0.5s ahead of `currentTime` — but in real continuous combat (rapid-fire onto multiple enemies, asteroid impacts, sustained beam contact) `nextPlayTime` accumulated faster than I modeled and the cap kicked in within seconds, silencing player-bullet hits, asteroid bumps, and enemy-bullet hits. A 2-second probe only saw mild drops; longer sustained gameplay hit the cap hard.

### Reverted
- Removed the `audioCursor` / `beginLogicTick` cross-tick spreading mechanism (v5.32.4) and the `nextPlayTime` per-sound repeat throttle (v5.32.5). `playSound()` is back to plain `src.start(0)` — same as v5.32.3. The "delayed then all at once" burst the cursor and throttle were trying to fix is a real but lower-priority phenomenon than dropped collision SFX; better to live with occasional same-tick stacking than have entire categories of sound silently disappear. `beginLogicTick(dtMs)` is kept as a no-op so the engine call site stays compatible if we revisit scheduling.

---

## [5.32.5] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **SFX still bursting "all at once after a delay" despite the v5.32.4 cursor fix.** The cursor only spread sounds across logic *ticks* — but multi-pellet weapons (SCATTER_GUN's 5 pellets), hitstop releases (a frame's worth of bullets all landing in the catch-up tick), and rapid-fire onto clusters all generate multiple plays of the *same* sound name *within one tick*. Same-tick plays share an audio timestamp by design, so Web Audio fired them simultaneously and the user heard one loud blast instead of distinct hits. Added a per-sound rolling cursor `nextPlayTime[soundName]` enforcing a 30ms minimum gap between repeats of the same name; different names coexist freely (a `playerHit_PULSE_CANNON` and an `explosion` in the same tick still play together — they're meant to). Repeats queued more than 500ms ahead of `currentTime` drop, so a sustained spray of one sound doesn't accumulate seconds of trailing audio that play after the action stopped.

---

## [5.32.4] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **SFX bursting after a perceived delay.** The game loop uses a fixed-step accumulator (`game-engine.js:1037`) that runs multiple `update()` ticks inside one `requestAnimationFrame` whenever the renderer hitches (long frame, hitstop release, post-pause catch-up). Every collision in those bunched-up ticks called `playSound()` synchronously, and each `src.start(0)` resolved to the same `AudioContext.currentTime` — Web Audio honored that and played them all at one instant instead of across the logical 16.67ms gaps the ticks actually represented. Now `AudioManager` carries an `audioCursor` that the engine advances via `beginLogicTick(dtMs)` before each fixed-step tick; `playSound()` schedules at the cursor (clamped to `currentTime`). Sounds inside one tick still share a stamp (correct — they happened "together" in game time), but sounds across bunched ticks march out by the tick interval. Clamping to `currentTime` keeps a stale cursor (e.g., long background-tab pause) from scheduling deep in the past.

---

## [5.32.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Per-weapon hit SFX (`playerHit_<weaponId>`) were silent for every primary weapon.** Only `createChargedBullets` (the charge-shot power) was stamping `bullet.weaponId`; the bullet pools spun up by `firePulseCannon`, `fireStormNeedles`, `fireScatterGun`, and `fireRailDriver` left `weaponId` undefined, so `audio:enemy-hit-by-bullet` resolved to the generic fallback `playHit`. Stamping moved into `applyGlobalBulletUpgrades` (the one chokepoint every primary fire path runs through) and unconditionally overwrites — bullets are pooled, so a stale weaponId from a previous use must be replaced, not preserved.
- **LANCE_BEAM hit-SFX never played.** The beam doesn't go through the bullet pool, so it bypassed the `audio:enemy-hit-by-bullet` emit in the bullet-vs-enemy collision branch. `checkLanceBeamCollisions` now emits the same event with `'LANCE_BEAM'` once per beam-tick, throttled to ~6/sec via `player._lastBeamHitSfx` so the short sustained tone doesn't smear into a buzz at 60fps.

---

## [5.32.2] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **SFX engine swapped to WebAudio.** Each `playSound()` now spins up a fresh `AudioBufferSourceNode` + `GainNode` per call, so concurrent voices are unbounded — no pool, no throttle, no rewinding of in-flight playback. The old HTMLAudioElement pool capped each sound at 2 simultaneous instances and rewound the oldest on overflow, which silenced rapid-fire SFX (player shoot, swarm bullet hits, multi-enemy explosions). Buffers are rendered once at init via `sfxr.toWebAudio(params, ctx)` (`AudioBufferSourceNode.buffer` extracted directly — no WAV byte round-trip). AudioContext is created lazily and resumed on the first user gesture (`initializeAudio()`) to satisfy autoplay policy. `rerollSound()` re-renders the buffer when params change. Background music stays on `HTMLAudioElement` (single long track, no concurrency need).

---

## [5.32.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **17 new procedural SFX** generated via SFXR for granular combat audio:
  - **Player damage**: `playerHitAsteroid` (low rocky thud), `playerHitEnemy` (sharp metallic clang).
  - **Enemy bullet hits player** — one per `shootPattern` (10 sounds): `hunter_single`, `guardian_spread`, `wasp_machinegun`, `charged_laser`, `arc_lightning`, `missile`, `spiral_laser`, `sentinel_sweep`, `lay_mine`, `sweep_laser`.
  - **Player bullet hits enemy/asteroid** — one per primary weapon (5 sounds): `PULSE_CANNON`, `STORM_NEEDLES`, `SCATTER_GUN`, `RAIL_DRIVER`, `LANCE_BEAM`.
- Player bullets now stamped with `bullet.weaponId = activePrimary` in `createChargedBullets`. Enemy bullets stamped with `firingPattern` via a thread-local `gameEngine._activeShotPattern` set by the `shoot()` dispatch wrapper and read in `EnemyBullet.reset()`.
- 5 new audio events on the engine bus (`audio:player-hit-asteroid`, `audio:player-hit-enemy`, `audio:player-hit-bullet`, `audio:enemy-hit-by-bullet`) with graceful fallback to generic `playHit` when a sound name isn't registered.

### Changed
- **Music playlist regenerated** — picked up 8 new tracks (55 → 63). Fixed stale `tools/music` relative path in `tools/scripts/generate-playlist.js` (was `../music`, needed to be `../../music` to resolve from `tools/scripts/`).

### Fixed
- **New SFX were silently dropped at runtime.** `playSound()` gates on `this.soundEnabled[soundName]`, but the new sounds weren't in the explicit 9-entry whitelist set in the constructor. Now `init()` auto-enables any sound registered in `audioCache` after the explicit list is built — original 9 keep their stable ordering for the SFX-toggle UI, all new SFX work without manual roster updates.

---

## [5.32.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Pause-menu PRIMARY tab** — lists every primary weapon (Pulse Cannon, Storm Needles, Scatter Gun, Rail Driver, Lance Beam). Click a row to equip. Primaries are free and always available. Active weapon shows an `EQUIPPED` badge in its signature color.
- **Pause-menu POWER tab** — same model as PRIMARY: lists all 5 power weapons (Charge Shot, Mine Layer, Nova Blast, Lightning Arc, Missile Salvo), free + click-to-equip. Adds to `ownedPowers` automatically on click for back-compat with `equipPower`'s gate.
- New `ui-manager._buildWeaponRow()` shared row builder using `createElement` + `textContent` (zero `innerHTML` — no XSS surface). Click handler wraps `onClick` with `e.stopPropagation()` so the click never reaches the pause-overlay's `dismissOnBackdrop`.
- Engine exposes `PRIMARY_WEAPONS_LIST` / `POWER_WEAPONS_LIST` so `ui-manager` can render the catalogs without importing `weapon-data` directly.

### Changed
- **Shop fullscreen redesign** matching the pause menu — drops the centered 600×500 windowed look. Now spans full viewport with 78% backdrop, edge margins, and a centered 900px-max content column for readability (mirrors the pause-menu's `min(900px, 100%)` rule).
- **Goldenrod scrollbar** — thin (12px) track + thumb, no arrow buttons, anchored to the right edge of the centered column. Track `#5a4509`, thumb `#FFC107`, hover/drag `#FFD740` — exactly matches the music-player CSS scrollbar.
- **Shop PRIMARY tab** now shows ONLY upgrades for the currently-equipped primary. Weapon SELECTION moved to the pause menu. Switching primaries in the pause menu causes the shop tab to repopulate with the new weapon's upgrades.
- **Shop POWER tab** mirrors PRIMARY — only shows upgrades for the currently-equipped power weapon, no buy items. (Power weapons are now free, granted on first click in the pause menu.)
- **Tab order** in pause menu: CONTROLS / PRIMARY / POWER / SKILLS / POWERUPS / MUSIC / SFX.
- **ESC inside the shop** routes to `closeShopToPause` via the existing `togglePause` SHOP→PAUSED branch, returning to the pause menu instead of gameplay.
- Updated shop footer instructions: `Click items to purchase  •  Press X or ESC to return to the pause menu`.

### Removed
- **Wave-gating** removed from both weapon catalog display (`_buildPrimaryTabItems`) and purchase logic (`_handleWeaponBuyOrEquip`). Every weapon was already free (cost: 0); they now appear and are equippable from wave 1. Bug: previously the `unlockWave` check silently returned `false` when clicking a wave-locked weapon, looking like the click did nothing.
- **Click-outside-shop-to-close** removed — easy to misclick. Shop only closes via the X button or ESC, both routed to `closeShopToPause`.

### Fixed
- **Pause menu closed on weapon-row click.** Sequence was: click row → row's listener calls `replaceChildren()` (re-render) → row is detached from DOM → click bubbles up to `dismissOnBackdrop` → `e.target.closest('#pause-menu')` returns null on the detached node → backdrop misclassifies as "click outside menu" → calls `togglePause()`. Fix: `e.stopPropagation()` in the row click wrapper before re-render. Applies to both PRIMARY and POWER tabs since they share `_buildWeaponRow`.

---

## [5.31.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Streak tier damage buff system** — kill streaks now grant tiered damage multipliers, replacing the previous one-tier "empowered" concept:
  | Kills | Tier         | Damage  | Color      |
  |-------|--------------|---------|------------|
  | 3+    | EMPOWERED    | +25%    | cyan       |
  | 6+    | UNSTOPPABLE  | +50%    | orange     |
  | 10+   | GODLIKE      | +75%    | pink-red   |
  | 15+   | LEGENDARY    | +100%   | gold (cap) |
- **Streak indicator HUD** (top-right corner, clear of pause button + minimap + enemy info + wave message). Three render modes:
  - **ACTIVE**: tier-colored count + label + `+X% DMG` + progress bar to the next tier (or `▲ MAX TIER` at LEGENDARY); pulses with shadow glow.
  - **SAVED**: dim grey-white when streak ≥ 3 but buff timer expired — `N KILLS / SAVED / ▶ KILL TO RE-ARM`.
  - **HIDDEN**: streak < 3 or 0.
- New constants in `weapon-data.js`: `STREAK_TIERS` (array of tier objects), `STREAK_BUFF_DURATION` (4000ms — buff timer refreshes on each new kill).

### Changed
- **No time-based streak reset.** Streak count persists indefinitely as long as the player avoids damage. Removed the old `STREAK_RESET_TIMEOUT = 3000ms` window and the corresponding decay in `updateKillStreak`.
- **Damage resets the streak.** New `_breakKillStreak()` engine helper hooked from all three player-damage paths: `lifecycle.takeDamage`, the direct `player.health -=` in `collision-system.js` for player↔enemy collision, and the same in player↔enemy-bullet collision. Phase Dash's `reducedDamage = 0` short-circuit means dashing through enemies preserves the streak. Bulwark's reduction still triggers (any HP loss counts).
- **`damageEnemy()`** now passes the bullet's `isCrit` / `isEmpowered` opts through to `enemy.takeDamage(damage, opts)` for AOE hits (mines, lightning, nova, missiles).

---

## [5.30.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Power weapon damage scale-down** — Charge Shot was the worst offender (one-shotting most enemies):
  - **Charge Shot**: `baseDamage` per stack +1 → +0.5; per-second damage +1.2 → +0.6; per-second crit chance +8% → +4%
  - **Mine Layer**: 5 → 3
  - **Nova Blast**: 4 → 2.5
  - **Lightning Arc**: 3 → 2
  - **Missile Salvo**: 2 → 1.5
- **Enemy stats overhaul** — all 10 enemies tuned for "starts off more intensely":
  - **Speed +25%** (HUNTER 1.6→2.0, GUARDIAN 1.0→1.25, WASP 2.8→3.5, etc.)
  - **Turn speed +50%** (`movement.turnSpeed: 0.08 → 0.12`, Titan 0.04→0.06)
  - **Evasion +50%** (`ai.evasion`, capped at 0.7 for Wasp)
  - **Burst delay −30%**, **fire cooldown floor −25%** (more aggressive firing)
  - **Health −25%** (e.g., HUNTER 16→12, TITAN 60→45)
  - **Size −15%** (smaller silhouettes are harder to land hits on)

### Fixed
- **`firePower` was overwriting `powerCooldown`** AFTER each weapon's discount-aware setter ran — silently cancelling Resonance / Tesla Coil / Quick Reload / new Rapid Deploy upgrades. Now `firePower` no longer touches `powerCooldown` and each weapon's fire fn owns its own cooldown.

---

## [5.30.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Mine Layer cooldown reducer** — new `RAPID_DEPLOY` upgrade (-25% cooldown per stack, max 2 stacks: 4s → 3s → 2.25s). Mine Layer was the only power weapon without a cooldown upgrade.
- **Per-primary velocity-and-damage upgrades** — 5 new shop entries (one per primary weapon), +12% bullet velocity AND +12% damage per stack, max 3 stacks (~+36% sustained DPS at max):
  - PULSE_CANNON → `PULSE_VELOCITY` (High-Velocity Rounds 🚄)
  - STORM_NEEDLES → `NEEDLE_VELOCITY` (Hypersonic Needles 🚄)
  - SCATTER_GUN → `SCATTER_VELOCITY` (Powder Charge 🚄)
  - RAIL_DRIVER → `RAIL_VELOCITY` (Tungsten Slug 🚄)
  - LANCE_BEAM → `LANCE_VELOCITY` (Focused Lens 🚄, range/damage variant since beam has no projectile speed)
- **Crit visualization** — damage-number popups now render distinctly:
  - **CRIT**: 26px bold orange-red with white outline + `CRIT!` tag above (was indistinguishable from normal hits — that's why "I am not seeing any crits" was the user's perception)
  - **EMPOWERED**: 20px cyan
  - **Standard**: 16px gold (unchanged)
- **`isCrit` / `isEmpowered` propagation** — `createDamageNumber(x, y, damage, opts)` accepts the flags, `enemy.takeDamage(damage, opts)` forwards them, all collision-system call sites updated.
- **Top-center enemy info panel** — large gold name + 280px health bar + LV / HP/Max numbers, driven by `lastHitEnemy` (most recently damaged target, not click-targeted). Asteroids show too with synthesized "ASTEROID" name. Snapshot system with 900ms grace prevents flicker between rapid kills.

### Changed
- **Auto-fire removed.** Left-click is now press-and-hold to fire primary; releasing stops fire. `InputHandler` tracks left mouse button as `input.fire`.
- **Power weapon trigger** is now right-click OR Spacebar (mirrored via `input.fireSecondary`). Spacebar `e.preventDefault()` stops page scroll.
- **Page-blur** clears both fire flags so a tab-switch mid-click doesn't strand the input.
- **Base crit chance** bumped 5% → 8% so crits show up more reliably during play.
- **Around-enemy nameplate stripped** — only the raw HP bar floats above each enemy now (no level / name / HP numbers there). All that info lives in the top-center panel.
- **Wave message + powerup pickup label pushed down** to clear the new top-center enemy panel (wave title y=80 → 200; powerup pickup y=120 → 250).
- **Orb minimum sizes bumped** — `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_MIN` 0.8 → 1.3, `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MIN` 1.0 → 1.3. Smallest drops were unreadable.
- **Controls panel** in pause menu rewritten: LEFT-CLICK fires primary (held), RIGHT-CLICK or SPACE fires power weapon, 1-4 activate skills.

### Fixed
- **Top-center enemy info panel flickered on every player hit.** Hitstop fires on every hit (3-5 frames), and the hitstop-branch render path called `drawHUD()` and `drawDamageNumbers()` but **not** `drawTargetInfo()`. The panel popped out for the duration of the freeze, then back in. Adding `this.drawTargetInfo()` to the hitstop branch keeps it solid.
- **One-frame staleness** in the panel — `_setLastHit` captured pre-damage HP, then snapshot-mirror updated post-damage HP next tick. Caused per-tick bar/numbers jitter on every Storm-Needles tick. Now the panel reads `info.ref.health` LIVE at draw time when the entity is alive, falls back to snapshot during the grace period after death.
- **Latent bug** in `combat-manager.getPowerupConfig` dynamic fallback path now correctly handles the new upgrade IDs (PULSE_VELOCITY etc.) without manual registration in the explicit configs map.

---

## [5.29.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Desktop-only gate at boot.** A new `isMobileOrTabletDevice()` check at the top of `js/main.js` runs before any game code initializes. If the browser reports a coarse pointer with no hover (`(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)`) OR a viewport narrower than 1024 px, the game is **not** initialized — no audio download, no canvas loop, no input handlers — and a fullscreen "Desktop only" panel is shown instead.
- **`#desktop-only-block` overlay** in `index.html` + CSS — fullscreen `Press Start 2P` panel with a 🖥️ icon, "Desktop only" headline, and a body explaining the game requires mouse and keyboard. `body.desktop-only-blocked > *:not(#desktop-only-block) { display: none !important }` ensures no leftover DOM peeks through behind it.

### Removed
- **All mobile / touch support** — Rainboids is now keyboard + mouse only. This is a behavior change for any users who were previously playing on a phone or tablet (movement-only mode); they will now hit the desktop-only block.
- **Touch input system in `InputHandler`** — `setupTouchControls`, dynamic two-finger joystick (`showDynamicJoystick`, `updateDynamicJoystick`, `hideDynamicJoystick`, `resetDynamicJoystick`), `testMultiTouch`, all `touchstart` / `touchmove` / `touchend` listeners, the `activeTouches`/`joystickTouchId`/`aimTouchId`/`joystickCenter` state, and the entire `isMobile()` method. Replaced with a clean keyboard + mouse only implementation.
- **Mobile auto-aim** in `game-engine.js update()` — the branch that locked the player's aim onto the nearest enemy when no mouse was present is gone.
- **Mobile branch in `updateControlsTab`** — the "LEFT THUMB / RIGHT THUMB / || BTN" instructions are removed; only the keyboard + mouse layout remains.
- **All canvas touch listeners in `event-setup.js`** — including the shop scroll/tap touch handlers.
- **Pause-menu touch listeners in `ui-manager.js`** — backdrop dismissal, shop button, resume button, HUD pause button, and tab switching all relied on `touchstart` to defeat synthetic-click suppression on mobile. Removed.
- **Window `touchstart` startGame listener** in `js/main.js`.
- **Mobile font-scaling** — the `fitFont` helper in `drawTitleScreen`, the `isMobile`-conditional font branches in `drawWavyText` (`hud/overlays.js`) and the wave message HUD (`hud/status.js`), and the "TAP TO START" alternate prompt are all gone. Title-screen text uses fixed sizes.
- **Mobile cursor early-return** in `hud/cursor.js`.
- **Mobile portrait restart prompt** in `player.js` — the "Tap Screen to Restart" alternate text was removed; game-over now always says "Press Enter to Restart".
- **`MOBILE_SCALE` constant** in `core/constants.js`, plus the 7 local `isMobile()` functions in `world/asteroid.js`, `world/color-star.js`, `world/background-star.js`, `player/player.js`, `player/bullet.js`, `player/weapons.js` that scaled entities by 0.65 on mobile. Replaced with always-1.
- **`<div id="orientation-overlay">`** (rotate-to-landscape message) and its CSS (`#orientation-overlay`, `.rotate-icon`).
- **`<div id="mobile-controls">`** container and its CSS (`#mobile-controls`, `.control-button`).
- **All mobile CSS media queries** — both `@media (max-width: 768px), (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` blocks (pause-menu scaling and `#mobile-controls` / `#score` / `#music-info` overrides).
- **`checkOrientation()` and `isPortrait()`** from `core/utils.js`. `triggerHapticFeedback()` is reduced to a no-op so existing call sites in `collision-system.js` keep linking but vibration code is gone.
- **Stub fall-through `inputHandler.setupTouchControls()`** call in `game-engine.start()`.
- Net code removal: ~500+ lines across `js/`, `css/`, `index.html`.

### Changed
- **Controls section in README** rewritten to a single keyboard + mouse list with a one-line note that the game is desktop / laptop only.
- **`InputHandler` rewritten from scratch** as a focused keyboard + mouse handler. Mouse-move no longer needs to skip synthetic touch events.
- **`updateControlsTab()`** simplified to a single layout (no platform branching).
- **`drawHUD()`** in `hud/status.js` no longer toggles between DOM and canvas pause buttons — always uses the DOM `#hud-pause-btn`.

### Verified
- Chromium @ 1280×720: desktop-only block hidden, `gameEngine` boots, state = `TITLE_SCREEN`, no console errors.
- Chromium emulating iPhone 13 (390×844, `hasTouch`, `isMobile`): desktop-only block visible, `body.desktop-only-blocked` set, `window.gameEngine` is `undefined` (game never initialized), no console errors.

## [5.28.2] - 2026-04-25

### Removed
- **Dead loading code purged from `js/main.js`** — removed `setupLoadingScreen`, `loadAssets`, `hideLoadingScreen`, the `assetLoader`/`loadingScreen` instance fields, the orphaned `AssetLoader` import, and several empty `if(canvas)` debug branches. The loading screen had been DOM-commented for a while; the JS plumbing is now gone too.
- **`js/modules/asset-loader.js` deleted** — no remaining importers anywhere in `js/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, or `index.html`.
- **Five orphan performance modules moved to `deprecated/js/modules/performance/`** — `enhanced-performance-manager.js`, `optimized-pool-manager.js`, `optimized-entities.js`, `particle-system-wrapper.js`, `performance-manager.js`. None had any importers. Active `js/modules/performance/` retains the 11 modules that are actually imported.

---

## [5.28.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Powerup-indicator icons not vertically centered in their circles** — `textBaseline: 'middle'` doesn't visually center emoji because the glyph's visual center isn't the em-box midpoint, so icons like ⭐ (Critical Chance) rode noticeably low. `drawPowerupIndicators` (`js/modules/hud/combat.js`) now measures each glyph with `ctx.measureText(...)` and offsets by `(actualBoundingBoxAscent − actualBoundingBoxDescent) / 2` from the alphabetic baseline, with constant fallbacks for browsers (older Safari) that report 0 metrics for emoji. All powerup icons now sit at their true visual center.

---

## [5.28.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Global health-orb drop cooldown** — green orbs now drop at most once every 60s by default (`HEALTH_DROP_COOLDOWN_BASE`). Without this throttle the player was effectively continuously healed and the game became trivial. Cooldown resets on game restart.
- **Triage defense upgrade** ⏳ — new SP-cost upgrade (2 SP, max 6 stacks) reduces the health-drop cooldown by 5s per stack down to a 30s floor. Available in the shop's DEFENSE tab; powerup-config + HUD indicator wired up.

### Changed
- **Game difficulty raised** — combination of the health-drop cooldown + smaller orb values means survival pressure is materially higher. Players who want pre-5.28.0 healing density should buy Triage stacks.

---

## [5.27.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **Money and health orb size caps lowered** — `HEALTH_ORB_SIZE_MAX` 2.5 → 1.4 and `MONEY_ORB_SIZE_MAX` 3.5 → 1.6. Orbs no longer balloon to massive sizes on big drops.
- **Drops split into many small orbs instead of one big one** — added per-orb value caps (`HEALTH_ORB_MAX_HEAL_PER_ORB: 2`, `MONEY_ORB_MAX_MONEY_PER_ORB: 20`). `dropOrbsFromEntity` now computes the legacy heal/money budget and splits it across `ceil(budget / cap)` smaller orbs whose values sum to the same total. Same total reward, denser visual feedback, no individual orb dominates the screen.
- **`createHealthOrb`/`createMoneyOrb` accept a value override** — used by the budget splitter; falls back to the existing min/max random formula when called without an override (back-compat for any other call sites).

---

## [5.27.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Powerup pickups now have full magnetism** — the spinning powerup entities use the same layered magnet behavior as money/health orbs in `color-star.js`: always-on base homing pull, ramped attraction inside 100px and again inside 40px, plus tractor-beam long-range pull when not charging. Forces are scaled by 0.55 since powerups are larger/heavier visually so they don't rocket into the player. Friction now matches `GAME_CONFIG.ORB_FRIC` for consistent feel. Replaces the previous weak 120px attraction radius.
- **`tractorEngaged` plumbed to `Powerup.update()`** — `game-engine.js` now passes the same flag the orbs already get.

---

## [5.26.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **Title screen optical alignment** — `RAINBOIDS` shifted +10px right to optically center with the subtitle below it (the wavy "R" leading edge sits left of where monospace baseline-centering suggests).
- **Subtitle/prompt text no longer bobs** — `SUPERCHARGED ASTEROIDS`, `PRESS ANY KEY TO START` / `TAP TO START`, `Survival Record`, and the in-game wave subtitle (`WAVE N INCOMING…`) now use `amplitude: 0` — gradient still slides across the text, but no vertical motion, for cleaner readability beneath the bigger wavy headline above each one.

---

## [5.26.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Wavy rainbow text rendering system** — new `drawWavyText(text, x, y, options)` API in `js/modules/hud/overlays.js` accepting `{ fontSize, colors, amplitude, speed, colorSpeed }`. Builds a single horizontal `CanvasGradient` spanning the whole word (2× text width with the palette laid down twice end-to-end), then slides it left over time. Every glyph uses the same gradient as `fillStyle`, so each pixel samples its color from its actual canvas-x position — adjacent letters blend continuously and the cycle wraps seamlessly without visible color snaps. Supports `amplitude: 0` for gradient-only / no vertical motion, and `colors` palettes wrap automatically (no need to duplicate the first stop at the end).
- **`pulsePalette(hex)` helper** (exported from `overlays.js`) — derives a 4-stop tint/shade pulse palette around any base color, cached per input hex. Used by the powerup pickup label so each powerup's identifying color reads instantly while the text shimmers.
- **Per-call-site palettes** in `WAVY_PALETTES`: `title` (vivid 6-stop rainbow), `waveTitle` (cyan→lime→yellow), `waveSubtext` (peach→pink→violet pastels), `gold`, `orange`, `combo`, `whiteShimmer`.

### Changed
- **All prominent screen-overlay text now uses wavy gradient rendering** — title (`RAINBOIDS`), subtitle (`SUPERCHARGED ASTEROIDS`), start prompt (`PRESS ANY KEY TO START` / `TAP TO START`), survival record, in-game wave indicator title and subtitle, powerup pickup name (top center), level-up text and its subtitle (bottom center). Each gets a hand-tuned palette derived from the color it was previously rendered in.
- **`drawWavyText` respects caller's outer `globalAlpha`** — captured once at entry and multiplied through its internal glow/crisp passes, so the powerup pickup fade-out, level-up fade in/out, and press-any-key alpha pulse all keep working correctly under the new wavy renderer.

---

## [5.25.2] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Enemy hit flash toned down to match asteroid intensity** — removed double-pass rendering (was additive + normal overlay), reduced fill opacity from 100% to 80%, and added 0.9 alpha multiplier. Enemy and asteroid hit flashes now have consistent visual weight.

---

## [5.25.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Enemy hit flash now fills entire hull** — shape draw functions were overriding white flash colors with their own per-component colors (body, wings, cockpit, engines). Fixed with a Proxy that intercepts all `fillStyle`/`strokeStyle` assignments during flash rendering, forcing them to white. All 10 enemy types now flash solid white on hit.
- **Enemy hit flash strengthened** — increased fill opacity to 100%, added double-pass rendering (additive + normal overlay), and removed the 0.9 alpha multiplier for a punchier impact read.

---

## [5.25.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Selective hitstop** — player ship, particles, line debris, and damage numbers keep updating during hitstop. Only enemies, asteroids, bullets, and collisions freeze. This sells "impact" instead of "lag" and keeps the player in control during combat.
- **Global hitstop budget** — max 10 frames of hitstop per second prevents stutter during intense combat. When budget is exhausted, hits still get flash/sound/shake but no freeze. Budget resets each second.
- **Per-weapon hitstop scaling** — heavy weapons (Rail Driver, Charge Shot: damage ≥ 2) get more hitstop than light rapid-fire weapons (Pulse Cannon, Storm Needles). Hit: 3f heavy / 2f light. Crit: 5f heavy / 3f light. Kill: 7f heavy / 5f light.
- **Kill hitstop for weapon effects** — mines, lightning, nova, and other damageEnemy() kills now trigger 4-frame hitstop.

### Changed

---

## [5.24.3] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- **Hitstop rebalance** — inflated all hitstop durations for better game-feel weight: asteroid hit 1→2f, enemy hit 3→4f, enemy crit 4→6f, player hit (bullet) 3→4f, player hit (enemy) 5→6f, player hit (asteroid) 4→6f.
- **Kill hitstop** — added dedicated hitstop on kills: enemy kill 7f (117ms), small asteroid kill 4f (67ms), large asteroid split 5f (83ms). Kills now feel distinctly punchier than regular hits.
- **Hitstop cooldown bypass** — lowered threshold from 5→4 frames so all kill hitstops punch through the 200ms rate-limit.
- **VFX test thresholds** — adjusted hitstop ratio and hit flash timer assertions to accommodate the intentionally heavier hitstop values.

---

## [5.24.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Waves stop progressing after 2-3 waves** — wave completion check counted enemies in death flash animation as alive (they have `active = true` until the flash finishes), preventing the wave from ever completing. Now excludes enemies with `_deathFlash > 0` from the alive count.

---

## [5.24.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Asteroid destroy freeze/screen tearing** — death flash and hit flash code referenced non-existent `vertices2D` property; asteroids use `projectedVertices`. Death flash threw TypeError every frame (causing freeze/tearing), hit flash silently failed (white flash never rendered).
- **Hit flash visibility on enemies and asteroids** — switched from `source-over` to `lighter` (additive) composite blending so white hull flash actually pops against the existing colored shape.

---

## [5.24.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **VFX telemetry system** — per-frame recording of all visual effect state (hitstop, screen shake, camera kick, screen flash, muzzle flash, entity hit/death flashes, particle counts) into a 3600-frame ring buffer. Enabled via `window.__VFX_TELEMETRY__ = true`. Zero cost when disabled.
- **VFX telemetry E2E tests** — 6 automated tests validating: full combat VFX analysis (15s AI gameplay), hit flash countdown, death flash sequence completion, muzzle flash telemetry detection, hitstop freeze-loop prevention, and screen shake decay. Includes analysis/report generation utilities.
- **Game loop error protection** — try/catch around the entire game loop prevents uncaught exceptions from killing the rAF chain.

### Fixed
- **Enemy death flash never rendered on bullet kills** — bullet-enemy collision called `enemyPool.release(enemy)` immediately, bypassing the `_deathFlash = 8` state set by `createEnemyDebris`. Removed the premature release; enemies now persist through their death flash animation and are cleaned up by `cleanupInactive()`.
- **White damage flash was a visible rectangle** — `source-atop` composite fills ALL non-transparent pixels on the canvas (including the background), creating a white square instead of a hull-shaped flash. Replaced with re-drawing the entity shape in white at flash alpha: enemies use `_deathFlashRendering` flag, asteroids use `vertices2D` polygon, player uses hull outline path.

## [5.23.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Enemy/asteroid damage white flash** — entity body now briefly tints white on bullet hit via `source-atop` compositing, making damage immediately visible on the entity silhouette (not just the localized impact glow).

### Fixed
- **Game freeze after 1-2 minutes** — hitstop frames did not update `lastFrameTime`, causing temporal upsampling to burst 4 logic updates at once after each hitstop. This killed more enemies, triggering more hitstop in a feedback loop. Fix: `lastFrameTime = frameStart` during hitstop prevents time accumulation.
- **Muzzle flash invisible** — core flash was only 6px radius with a 0.9px streak. Tripled flash size (core `r*0.8` → `r*1.4`), widened streak (`r*0.06` → `r*0.25`), added side flare spikes for heavy weapons, and increased duration (2-5 → 3-8 frames).

## [5.23.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Game freeze from hitstop stacking** — rapid-fire weapons could lock the game in permanent hitstop. Added 200ms cooldown between non-death hitstops so frames expire before re-triggering.
- **HUD disappearing during hitstop** — hitstop rendering path now includes the full pipeline (HUD, damage numbers, money display, screen flash) instead of only calling `draw()`.
- **Death flash invisible for enemies** — death silhouette now starts at 1.5x scale (was 1.0x) so the white flash is immediately distinct from the normal enemy appearance.
- **Charge shot missing muzzle flash** — `fireChargedShot` now triggers heavy muzzle flare matching other heavy weapons.

### Changed
- Increased hit flash radius: enemy 0.55x → 0.75x, asteroid 0.5x → 0.65x for more visible localized impacts.
- Increased hit hitstop: regular 2→3 frames, crit 3→4 frames for more tactile feedback.

## [5.23.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Muzzle flare** — player weapons now emit additive flash + directional sparks at the barrel tip on every shot. Intensity scales by weapon type: light (Storm Needles), medium (Pulse Cannon), heavy (Scatter Gun, Rail Driver, power weapons).
- **Hit hitstop** — brief frame-freeze on bullet impacts: 2 frames for regular hits, 3 for crits, 1 for asteroid hits. Combined with screen shake, gives every hit tactile weight.

### Changed
- **Death animation overhaul** — enemies and asteroids now persist for 6-8 frames after death, rendering as a bright white silhouette that scales up 30-35% then fades/shrinks. This replaces the previous invisible gradient approach where entities vanished instantly during hitstop. A large additive glow radiates behind the white silhouette for dramatic visibility.
- **Localized damage effects** — hit flash now emanates from the bullet impact point on the enemy hull instead of the entity center. Flash radius reduced from 1.15x to 0.55x entity radius. Debris sparks fly in a directional cone away from bullet travel direction instead of radiating uniformly.
- **Explosion flash particles** — `explosionFlash` uses radial gradient rendering (bright core → soft blue edge), starts at 30% radius (visible during hitstop), lives 50% longer. `explosionRingColored` also starts partially visible.
- **Enemy death effects** — hitstop 8→5 frames, bigger flash (3x radius), 4 staggered rings, core glow cluster, more shrapnel (20-30), two cascading delayed bursts.
- **Asteroid death effects** — hitstop reduced, bigger flash, third ring at 150ms, core glow cluster, two delayed bursts.
- **Ember particles** — larger (1.2-3.5, was 1-3) and longer-lived (1.0-1.8s, was 0.8-1.5s).

## [5.22.2] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: novice aim too weak** — aimAccuracy raised from 0.10 to 0.25 with minimal lead aiming (0.05). Previous value caused infinite-duration waves where novice couldn't kill enemies, hanging sessions for hours.

### Changed
- **QA Bot: health-aware retreat** — all skill levels now reduce pursuit aggression when health < 40% and increase retreat urgency. Bots also become more cautious when surrounded by multiple visible enemies.
- **QA Bot: wider engagement ranges** — all weapon engagement ranges increased (e.g., STORM_NEEDLES min 100->180px) so bots fight from safer distances.
- **QA Bot: reduced pursuit aggression** — expert lowered from 0.95 to 0.65, advanced from 0.82 to 0.55. Prevents higher-skill bots from rushing into danger and dying faster than lower-skill bots.

## [5.22.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: weakest-link floor** — composite fun score no longer zeroes out when any dimension scores 0. Multiplier now has 0.3x floor (minimum 30% of weighted average preserved).

## [5.22.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **QA Bot: fun score recalibration** — all dimension scorers rebuilt with lower baselines: engagement starts at 60 (was 100), challenge balance at 65 (was 100), pacing at 50 (was 100). Scores now earn points for quality rather than losing points from a perfect start.
- **QA Bot: pacing scorer earns-based** — must earn points via tension arcs (+20), tension variety (+12), rest quality (+8), and intensity escalation (+8). Expected range 25-80 instead of 80-100.
- **QA Bot: engagement penalties harsher** — low action density (<0.3 events/s) now -8 per wave (was -5). Compounding penalty for 3+ low-action waves. Near-zero dips penalized -7 each.
- **QA Bot: challenge balance tightened** — "too easy" threshold lowered from 12:1 to 8:1 damage ratio. Deaths now penalized (-3 per death, -10 per extra). Sweet spot narrowed to 2-6:1.
- **QA Bot: excitement death penalty** — high death rate (>0.5/wave) now penalizes up to -20. Desperation bonuses (health crises, survival recoveries) capped lower (+5/+6 instead of +8/+10).
- **QA Bot: competence growth R² gating** — slope rewards require R² > 0.15 (statistical significance). Noisy trends no longer get free credit.
- **QA Bot: composite weakest-link penalty** — if any dimension scores below 35, the composite is multiplied by (min/35), preventing one terrible dimension from being hidden.
- **QA Bot: rating labels adjusted** — Excellent ≥80 (was 85), Good ≥60 (was 70), Fair ≥45 (was 55), Poor ≥30 (was 40).

## [5.21.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: freeze when surrounded** — bot no longer returns zero movement when all 16 steering directions have danger ≥ 1.0. Now flees toward the least dangerous direction instead of freezing in place and dying.
- **QA Bot: bullet dodge threshold** — dynamic threshold scaled by bullet speed and reaction time (60-150px) instead of fixed 60px. Gives all skill levels adequate reaction distance.
- **QA Bot: danger curve overflow** — danger map now capped at 1.5 maximum per direction. Prevents 3+ enemies from making all directions impassable and triggering the freeze bug.
- **QA Bot: wall danger trapping** — wall danger now scales with proximity (0-0.5) instead of flat 0.7 inside WALL_MARGIN. Eliminates corner trapping when combined with enemy danger.
- **QA Bot: respawn chain deaths** — 2.5s grace period after respawn where bot flees toward arena center instead of fighting. Prevents immediate re-death near edge spawns.
- **QA Bot: degradation curve** — changed from linear to quadratic. Advanced (0.88 skill) now gets 0.9% drift (was 9%) and 0.5% hesitation (was 5%). Novice retains substantial degradation.

### Changed
- **QA Bot: skill presets widened further** — beginner pulled down (aimAccuracy 0.4→0.30, bulletAwareness 0.3→0.20, threatBlindness 0.3→0.40), advanced pushed up (movementSkill 0.85→0.88, bulletAwareness 0.9→0.92, threatBlindness 0.05→0.03). Novice made more extreme (reactionMs 600→700, aimAccuracy 0.15→0.10). Creates wider gaps between all 5 skill tiers.

## [5.20.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **QA Bot: expert skill level** — new peak-human-capability tier with 50ms reaction time, 0.98 aim accuracy, 0.97 movement skill, full bullet awareness, and near-perfect lead aiming. Five skill levels now span novice → beginner → intermediate → advanced → expert.
- **QA Bot: tension arc analysis** — per-tick tension signal computed from enemy proximity, bullet density, health pressure, and damage spikes. Analyzes build-to-peak-to-release cycles, rest period quality (short recovery after combat = good, long dead time = bad), and intensity escalation across the session.
- **QA Bot: combat effectiveness metric** — replaces broken "accuracy" proxy with geometric mean of offense (damage ratio) and defense (health floor). Used for competence growth trend analysis.
- **QA Bot: threat blindness** — low-skill AI now ignores a fraction of enemies entirely (50% for novice, 0% for expert), creating realistic tunnel vision behavior.
- **QA Bot: reaction jitter** — low-skill AI has inconsistent reaction times (±40% for novice, ±1% for expert), simulating human inconsistency.
- **QA Bot: movement commitment** — low-skill AI commits to bad movement directions for longer (2s for novice, 50ms for expert), simulating poor spatial awareness.
- **QA Bot: separate movementSkill parameter** — movement degradation (drift, hesitation, panic) now controlled independently from aimAccuracy, allowing finer skill tuning.

### Changed
- **QA Bot: pacing scorer rewritten** — now measures tension arcs, tension variety, rest quality, intensity escalation, and tension-based monotony instead of action density oscillation and idle ratio penalties.
- **QA Bot: engagement scorer updated** — idle time only penalized when rest quality is poor (< 40%), not unconditionally above 30%.
- **QA Bot: skill presets widened** — all parameter ranges expanded for clearer differentiation. Novice aimAccuracy lowered from 0.3 to 0.15; advanced reactionMs changed from 100 to 120; intermediate values adjusted for smoother progression.

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: damage dealt always 1 per kill** — kill buffer now includes enemy `maxHealth`. Damage ratio reflects actual enemy HP destroyed vs damage taken, fixing universally poor challenge balance scores.
- **QA Bot: competence growth always 35** — replaced kills/(kills+damageTaken) accuracy proxy with combat effectiveness (offense × defense geometric mean). Competence growth now reflects actual improvement.
- **QA Bot: dead code removed** — removed fire hesitation code (`input.fire` is never consumed by game engine), removed unused `dodgeReactionMs` and `dodgeCommitment` parameters from all skill presets.

## [5.19.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **QA Bot: skill-dependent movement degradation** — novice AI now exhibits random drift, movement hesitation, panic-mode erratic movement at low health, aim wander (consistent directional bias), and fire hesitation. Creates visible differentiation: novice reaches 73% of advanced's wave count and takes 17% more damage per wave.

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: near-miss detection always zero** — rewrote proximity tracker with velocity-prediction-based bullet matching and line segment interpolation for closest approach between 10Hz samples. Widened near-miss radius from 40px to 80px. Sessions now detect 47-147 near-misses per run.
- **QA Bot: engagement score too strict** — lowered action density thresholds (1.0→0.3 events/s for low density, 5.0→3.0 for chaos). Added close_encounter (enemy within 200px) and bullet_threat (approaching bullet within 150px) action event types. Engagement scores now 92-97 across skill levels.
- **QA Bot: duplicate `const now` declaration** — removed redeclared variable in fun-metrics-collector.js tick method.

## [5.19.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **QA Bot: context steering combat AI** — replaced simple approach/flee movement with 16-direction interest/danger map system. Bot now pursues enemies to weapon-effective range, circle-strafes during engagement, dodges incoming bullets via velocity obstacle projection, and avoids arena boundaries and asteroids. All parameters tunable per skill level.
- **QA Bot: predictive lead aiming** — quadratic intercept calculation predicts where moving enemies will be when bullets arrive. Lead factor ranges from 0 (novice, aims at current position) to 0.95 (advanced, near-perfect prediction).
- **QA Bot: weighted target prioritization** — targets scored by threat level, distance, health remaining, and angle proximity instead of simple nearest-enemy selection. Includes target switch cooldown and hysteresis to prevent oscillation.
- **QA Bot: weapon-specific engagement** — combat AI adjusts ideal engagement distance per weapon type (SCATTER_GUN: 50-200px close range, RAIL_DRIVER: 350-650px long range, etc.).
- **QA Bot: utility-based shop AI** — replaces hardcoded priority lists with need-score system driven by session telemetry. Tracks health ratio, death rate, kill rate across waves; computes per-upgrade need scores; applies value=need/cost scoring with build archetype bias. Adaptive build strategy re-evaluates archetype every 5 waves based on performance.
- **QA Bot: session telemetry tracking** — shop AI records wave-by-wave stats (health, kills, deaths, damage events) to inform purchase decisions.
- **QA Bot: enhanced skill presets** — SKILL_PRESETS now include nested `combat` and `shop` parameter blocks with 12+ tunable parameters per skill level.

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: wave skipping during shop visits** — bot was opening shop during WAVE_TRANSITION and closeShop() called startNextWave(), skipping the current wave's enemy spawn entirely. Added `closeShopSilent()` driver method that restores WAVE_TRANSITION state without triggering startNextWave.
- **QA Bot: fun metrics missing wave data** — fun metrics collector was only called during PLAYING state, missing wave_start events during SHOP and WAVE_TRANSITION. Moved event processing before state guard; added funCollector.tick calls on all early-return paths.
- **QA Bot: enemy velocity not tracked** — state reader now captures enemy `vx`/`vy` for predictive aiming.
- **QA Bot: asteroid dodge weakness** — increased asteroid danger radius (scales with asteroid size) and danger intensity from 0.4 to 0.7 * dangerSensitivity.

## [5.18.3] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: kill tracking accuracy** — replaced delta-based kill inference (compared enemy counts between 100ms ticks, missed kills during state transitions) with an authoritative event buffer. Kill events are now pushed from all three game-side kill paths (bullet-enemy collision, power weapon `damageEnemy`, player-enemy body collision) and a fallback in `enemy.update()`. State reader drains the buffer each tick for 100% accurate kill counts regardless of timing.

## [5.18.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **QA Bot: wave progression fix** — adapter `startSequence` was forcing game state to PLAYING immediately after `init()`, which prevented the 2-second wave intro timer from spawning wave 1 entities; bot now waits for the natural WAVE_TRANSITION → PLAYING transition

## [5.18.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Shop close → wave progression bug** — `closeShop()` was calling the broken `startNewWave()` (which doesn't increment wave counter, doesn't spawn enemies, and never transitions back to PLAYING) instead of the correct `startNextWave()`; this caused the game to get permanently stuck after closing the shop during a wave transition

## [5.18.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **QA Bot: Fun Metrics System** — New analysis pipeline that quantifies "fun" across six research-backed dimensions:
  - **Engagement** — action density, threat saturation, idle ratio, engagement dips
  - **Challenge Balance** — death rate, damage ratios, wave clear time, difficulty spikes
  - **Competence Growth** — accuracy trends, kill efficiency trends, damage ratio progression
  - **Choice Depth** — Shannon entropy of upgrade/build diversity across sessions
  - **Pacing** — intensity oscillation, monotony detection, density trends
  - **Excitement** — near-miss tracking, health crises, clutch kills, multi-kill bursts, survival recoveries
- **Near-miss proximity tracker** (`analysis/proximity-tracker.js`) — detects bullets that pass close to the player without hitting, measuring combat tension
- **Per-wave analysis buckets** (`analysis/wave-bucket.js`) — accumulates granular per-wave statistics for intensity curves and hotspot detection
- **Fun Analyzer** (`analysis/fun-analyzer.js`) — scores each dimension 0-100, computes weighted composite fun score, identifies problem waves, generates actionable recommendations
- **Fun Report Generator** (`analysis/fun-report-generator.js`) — produces both human-readable markdown and machine-readable JSON fun reports per session and aggregated across sessions
- Fun scores now printed in CLI output after each session
- Aggregate fun reports generated automatically when running multiple sessions
- Cross-session choice depth analysis using Shannon entropy of upgrade distributions

## [5.17.2] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Drifter lightning orbs now linger as visible electric hazards** — Lightning damage bullets persist for 1–1.5s (up from 460ms) with a smooth fade over their final 40% of lifetime. Orbs are now visible with a cyan glow and drift slightly from their spawn point, making them readable area-denial hazards rather than invisible instant damage zones.

## [5.17.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Drifter lightning bullets persist forever** — Arc lightning damage bullets were created with `maxLifetimeOverride = 460` but `isPersistent` was never set to `true`, so the lifetime check never ran. Since the bullets have zero velocity, the distance-based expiry also never triggered. Every lightning bolt spawned ~4 invisible immortal bullets that accumulated indefinitely, causing progressive performance degradation. Fixed by setting `isPersistent = true` on lightning damage bullets.

## [5.17.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Domain-oriented directory reorganization** — Restructured `js/modules/` from technical-layer grouping (entities/, systems/, rendering/) to domain-oriented grouping where related code is colocated:
  - `player/` — player entity, weapons, skills, progression, renderer, lifecycle, bullet (7 files)
  - `enemy/` — enemy entity, data, movement, firing, AI, shapes, enemy-bullet (7 files)
  - `hud/` — all HUD rendering split by domain: status, combat, navigation, overlays, cursor (6 files)
  - `world/` — game world entities: asteroid, particle, color-star, background-star, line-debris, powerup, camera (7 files)
  - `combat/` — collision system, combat manager, weapon data, weapon effects renderer (4 files)
  - `wave/` — wave manager + wave data (2 files)
  - `shop/` — shop manager + shop renderer (2 files)
  - `audio/` — audio manager + music player (2 files)
  - `ui/` — UI manager, input handler, event setup (3 files)
  - `core/` — absorbed loose infrastructure: constants, utils, frame-clock, color-cache, pool-manager (8 files)
  - `game-engine.js`, `asset-loader.js`, `autofire-diag.js` remain at module root
  - Old directories (entities/, systems/, rendering/) removed
- All import paths updated across game code, unit tests, and benchmark scripts. No code logic changes.

## [5.16.1] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 10.1 — Externalize wave subtitles** — Moved 50 hand-written wave subtitle strings and 15 generic fallback subtitles from `wave-manager.js` to `wave-data.js` as `WAVE_SUBTITLES` and `WAVE_SUBTITLES_GENERIC` exports. `getWaveSubtitle()` now reads from the imported data. Pure data relocation, no behavior change.

## [5.16.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 9.1 — Split hud-renderer.js** — Decomposed monolithic `hud-renderer.js` (2,058 LOC, 32 functions) into 5 focused modules:
  - `hud-status.js` — health bar, lives, level/coins, XP bar, skill cooldowns, updateHUD orchestrator (7 functions)
  - `hud-combat.js` — damage numbers, target info, powerup display/indicators/sync, money pickup (6 functions)
  - `hud-navigation.js` — minimap, off-screen enemy edge glow indicators (2 functions)
  - `hud-overlays.js` — title screen, wavy text, survival timer, pause button, spawn/respawn/invincibility timers, ghost previews (12 functions)
  - `hud-cursor.js` — crosshairs, targeting cursor, jitter circle, charge cooldown timer (5 functions)
  - Original `hud-renderer.js` retained as barrel re-export for backward compatibility. No behavior change.

## [5.15.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 8.2 — Collision Config** — Extracted 15 hardcoded collision physics values (knockback, restitution, damage, drop chances, push forces, separation buffers) into a named `COLLISION_CONFIG` object at the top of `collision-system.js` for easy tuning and discoverability.
- **Architecture: Phase 8.3 — Split handleWeaponEffectCollisions** — Decomposed monolithic `handleWeaponEffectCollisions()` into 7 focused handler functions: `checkLanceBeamCollisions`, `checkMineCollisions`, `checkNovaCollisions`, `checkLightningCollisions`, `checkMissileCollisions`, `checkDeflectorOrbCollisions`, `checkTractorShieldCollisions`. No behavior change.

## [5.14.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 7 — Player Subsystem Extraction** — Decomposed `player.js` (2,263 lines) into 5 focused modules:
  - `systems/player-weapons.js` (924 lines) — 35 weapon methods: charging, primary/power firing, bullet creation, charge shot, weapon equip/buy
  - `systems/player-skills.js` (158 lines) — 5 skill methods: activation, cooldowns, equip, buy
  - `systems/player-progression.js` (284 lines) — 18 methods: leveling, powerups, stat getters
  - `rendering/player-renderer.js` (513 lines) — 5 draw methods: ship, charging effects, level-up, cooldown timers
  - `player.js` reduced from 2,263 to 702 lines (69% reduction). No behavior change.

## [5.13.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 6.5 — Enemy AI Extraction** — Extracted 21 enemy AI/evasion/territory methods (~700 lines) from `enemy.js` to new `systems/enemy-ai.js`. Includes face direction, targeting priority, territory system (initialize, patrol, bounds), evasion (dodge bullets, avoid asteroids, line-of-sight), distance maintenance, micro-movements, fish-like motion, and trail particles. `enemy.js` reduced from 1,649 to 1,011 lines (85% reduction from original 6,655). No behavior change.

## [5.12.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 6.4 — Rendering Shape Extraction** — Extracted all 25 enemy drawing/rendering methods (~1,800 lines) from `enemy.js` to new `rendering/enemy-shapes.js`. Includes all shape renderers (drawTriangle, drawWaspShip, drawEmeraldGuardian, drawTitanTank, drawStalkerSword, etc.), effect renderers (drawWarpEffect, drawLightningBolt, drawSweepLaser, drawLaserChargingEffect, etc.), and HUD elements (drawHealthBar, drawLightTrail, drawTargetingEffect, drawPulsatingCircle). Enemy class methods become one-liner `.call(this)` delegators. The main `draw()` orchestrator remains in `enemy.js`. `enemy.js` reduced from ~3,400 to ~1,650 lines. No behavior change.

## [5.11.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 6.3 — Firing Strategy Extraction** — Extracted 38 enemy firing/shooting functions from `enemy.js` to new `systems/enemy-firing.js`. Includes all shooting patterns (shootAimed, shootSpread, shootLaser, shootArcLightning, shootMissile, etc.), the core `createEnemyBullet` bullet factory, burst/sweep/sentinel state machines, and lightning bolt generation. Enemy class methods become one-liner `.call(this)` delegators. Drawing methods (`drawLightningBolt`, `drawSweepLaser`) and the `updateShooting` dispatcher remain in `enemy.js`. No behavior change.

## [5.10.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 6.2 — Movement Strategy Extraction** — Extracted 36 enemy movement functions (~2,170 lines) from `enemy.js` to new `systems/enemy-movement.js`. Includes all 28 movement patterns (chase, patrol, drifter_wave, triangle, square, boulder, weaver_spinup, wasp_zigzag, tank, arc, etc.) plus 8 helper functions (startFishDart, calculateTriangleVertices, etc.). Enemy class methods become one-liner `.call(this)` delegators. `enemy.js` reduced from 6,544 to 4,443 lines (32% reduction). No behavior change.

## [5.9.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 6.1 — Extract Enemy Config** — Moved `ENEMY_TYPES` (10 enemy type definitions) from `enemy.js` to new `entities/enemy-data.js`. Expanded each type's config with structured `movement`, `firing`, `visual`, and `ai` parameter blocks for future strategy registry consumption (Phases 6.2–6.4). Added `ENEMY_TYPE_KEYS` and `SHAPE_DRAW_MAP` convenience exports. Pure data extraction — no behavior change.

## [5.8.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 3.9 — EventSetup extraction** — Extracted `setupEventListeners` (~434 lines) into `systems/event-setup.js`: window resize/orientation, keyboard shortcuts, cheat codes, game restart handlers, shop interaction, entity targeting, auto-pause
- **Architecture: Phase 4.1 — EventBus wiring** — Activated the existing EventBus for cross-system communication. All 31 `audioManager` calls and 16 `uiManager` calls in extracted modules now use `this.events.emit()` instead of direct method calls. Audio events: `audio:hit`, `audio:explosion`, `audio:coin`, `audio:shield`, `audio:health-regen`, `audio:powerup`, `audio:player-explosion`. UI events: `ui:show-message`, `ui:hide-message`, `ui:update-lives`, `ui:check-orientation`, `ui:toggle-pause`, `ui:show-shop-button`, `ui:hide-shop-button`, `ui:show-pause-btn`, `ui:hide-pause-btn`
- Removed all direct `audioManager` and `uiManager` references from extracted system modules (collision-system, player-lifecycle, combat-manager, shop-manager, event-setup, wave-manager) and rendering modules (hud-renderer)
- **Architecture: Phase 4.2 — Remove `window.gameEngine` from game code** — All entity files (enemy.js, player.js, enemy-bullet.js, asteroid.js) and ui-manager.js no longer read from `window.gameEngine` or `window.game`. Entities receive gameEngine via injected `this.gameEngine` ref; UIManager receives it via `setGameEngine()`. Global assignment kept only for test instrumentation.
- **Architecture: Phase 5.3 — Pool high-water-mark tracking** — Added `highWaterMark`, `totalAllocations`, `overflowAllocations` tracking to PoolManager. Call `gameEngine.showPerformanceStats()` in console to see pool sizing audit data via `console.table()`.
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 3,081 to ~1,260 lines (84% reduction from original 7,746)

## [5.7.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 3.5 — CombatManager extraction** — Extracted 22 combat/effects methods (~611 lines) into `combat-manager.js`: debris effects (asteroid + enemy), orb creation/drops, powerup collection, kill streak tracking, damage numbers, money pickup display, entity targeting/hover detection
- **Architecture: Phase 3.6 — PlayerLifecycle extraction** — Extracted 9 player death/respawn methods (~379 lines) into `player-lifecycle.js`: `takeDamage`, `handlePlayerDeath`, `createPlayerShipDebris`, `respawnPlayer`, `respawnPlayerSafely`, `findSafeRespawnLocation`, `updateRespawnAnimation`, `clearAreaAroundPlayer`, `explodeTank`
- **Architecture: Phase 3.7 — WeaponEffectsRenderer extraction** — Extracted `drawWeaponEffects` (~196 lines) into `rendering/weapon-effects-renderer.js`: lance beam, mines, nova rings, lightning chains, missiles, deflector orbs, bulwark, tractor shield, EMP pulse, phase dash
- Removed unused `PRIMARY_UPGRADES`, `POWER_UPGRADES`, `SKILL_UPGRADES`, `PRIMARY_WEAPONS`, `POWER_WEAPONS` imports from `game-engine.js`
- **Architecture: Phase 3.8 — Spawning methods moved to WaveManager** — Moved 9 spawning methods (~196 lines) into existing `wave-manager.js`: `spawnAsteroidOffscreen`, `spawnWaveAsteroids`, `startEnemySubWave`, `forceSpawnEntity`, `forceSpawnEnemy`, `forceSpawnAsteroid`, `isInMinimapArea`, `spawnContinuousAsteroid`, `spawnRandomEnemy`
- **Architecture: Phase 3.9 — EventSetup extraction** — Extracted `setupEventListeners` (~434 lines) into `systems/event-setup.js`: window resize/orientation, keyboard shortcuts, cheat codes, game restart handlers, shop click/touch/scroll handling, entity targeting, auto-pause on blur
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 3,081 to 1,248 lines (total 84% reduction from original 7,746)

## [5.6.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 3.4 — CollisionSystem extraction** — Extracted 8 collision methods (~1,142 lines) into `collision-system.js`: `handleCollisions`, `handleWeaponEffectCollisions`, `damageEnemy`, `handlePlayerEnemyCollision`, `handlePlayerEnemyBulletCollision`, `handleEnemyAsteroidCollision`, `handlePlayerAsteroidCollision`, `findNearestEnemy`
- **Architecture: Phase 4 — GameDimensions fix** — Added `FIELD_WIDTH`/`FIELD_HEIGHT` constants to `GAME_CONFIG`, updated `GameDimensions` singleton to return fixed game field dimensions (1920×1080) instead of window viewport size, and removed all `window.gameEngine?.gameField` fallback chains from entity code (enemy.js, asteroid.js, enemy-bullet.js)
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 4,206 to 3,081 lines (total 60% reduction from original 7,746)

### Fixed
- Duplicate shield initialization in `enemy.js` (lines 221-229 and 299-307 were identical; removed the first redundant copy)
- `GameDimensions` was returning window viewport size instead of game field dimensions, which could cause entity boundary checks to use incorrect values on non-1080p displays

## [5.5.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Project reorganization** — Moved 10 planning/analysis docs (including REFACTOR.md) into `docs/` and development tools (`benchmark/`, `ai-qa-bot/`, `scripts/`, `juice-capture.mjs`) into `tools/` to declutter the project root
- Updated all internal path references in `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `benchmark/compare.js`, `benchmark/run.js`, `ai-qa-bot/run.js`, and `ai-qa-bot/core/config.js` to reflect new locations

## [5.5.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 1 Foundation** — Added `GameStateMachine` (validated state transitions with epoch guards), `EventBus` (cross-system pub/sub), and `GameTimer` (frame-counted timers that freeze during pause/shop)
- **Architecture: Phase 2 Renderer Extraction** — Extracted 32 HUD draw methods (~2,058 lines) into `hud-renderer.js` and 4 shop draw methods (~619 lines) into `shop-renderer.js`
- **Architecture: Phase 3 System Extraction** — Extracted camera management (~109 lines) into `camera-manager.js`, shop logic (~528 lines) into `shop-manager.js`, and wave system (~441 lines) into `wave-manager.js`
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 7,746 lines to 4,206 lines (46% reduction) while preserving identical feature-set and behavior
- All game-logic `setTimeout` calls replaced with `GameTimer` instances that respect pause/shop state — eliminates stale-callback bugs
- All state transitions now validated against a transition table — prevents invalid state changes

### Fixed
- Wave spawn timers no longer fire during PAUSED or SHOP states (was a source of ghost spawning bugs)
- State transition validation prevents impossible state changes (e.g., GAME_OVER → SHOP)
- Respawn timer now uses epoch guard to prevent stale respawn callbacks after game restart

## [5.4.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Weapons were purchasable in shop before reaching their unlockWave milestone, bypassing wave-gating entirely
- Shop PRIMARY tab now hides locked weapons until the player reaches the required wave
- `buyShopItem()` now rejects purchases of wave-locked weapons even if called programmatically

### Added
- E2E weapon economy analysis test suite (simulated 15-wave playthrough with purchase tracking)

- Weapon stat differentiation test (verifies Pulse Cannon rebalance + unique damage values)

## [5.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Primary weapons are now free — no coin or SP cost to acquire
- Primary weapons auto-unlock at wave milestones (Storm Needles at wave 3, Scatter Gun at wave 5, Rail Driver at wave 8, Lance Beam at wave 12)
- Reduced all 19 primary weapon upgrade costs by ~30% to redirect spending toward build depth
- Pulse Cannon rebalanced: damage 1.0→0.8, range 1.0→0.85 to incentivize weapon switching
- Shop chrome shifted from gold (#FFD700) to cyan (#00ccff) to match game's HUD aesthetic — title, border, scrollbar all cyan; gold preserved only for coin currency display
- Shop tab label font size increased from 9px to 10px for readability
- Purchase feedback: green flash on successful buy, red flash on insufficient funds

### Added
- AI playtester weapon-switching support (`switchWeapons` option in `GameAI.run()`)
- `switchRandomPrimary()` method on GameAI for periodic weapon variety testing
- Weapon test helpers: `getActivePrimary()`, `getOwnedPrimaries()`, `equipPrimary()`
- QA tests for free weapon costs, wave-milestone auto-unlock, and AI weapon switching

## [5.3.3] - 2026-03-18

### Removed
- Dead `gameOver()` method (~150 lines of unused rainbow explosion code)

## [5.3.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Game starting at wave 2 due to `main.js` and `startGame()` force-setting
  state to PLAYING, bypassing the wave transition setTimeout
- Wave progression broken after wave 1 (entities never spawned because
  setTimeout callback checked for WAVE_TRANSITION but state was forced
  to PLAYING)
- Duplicate `startNextWave()` method (old dead version at line 847 merged
  into the real one with pool cleanup, health restore, player state reset)

## [5.3.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Depth-batch-renderer NaN crash: `Math.max`/`Math.min` passes NaN through;
  replaced with bitwise `|0` coercion + ternary bounds check

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Four-phase player death effect: impact freeze, ship fragmentation, main
  blast with shockwave rings, and delayed aftershock re-ignition pops
- Ship hull debris: player hull fragments into 12 line-debris pieces along
  actual hull geometry on death, flung outward with rotation
- Death overlay: brief dark-blue tint after death (holds longer on game over)
- Three sequential camera kicks on player death (25px, 18px, 10px)
- 15-frame hitstop on player death (longest in the game)
- Pithy/humorous wave subtitles for all 50 hand-written waves plus a rotating
  pool of 15 generic quips for waves 51+
- Wave 1 intro message with 2-second delay before spawning
- Wave transition delay on all waves (2s message → spawn)

### Changed
- Player death is now the most dramatic effect in the game, strictly above
  enemy kills in every feedback channel (hitstop, flash, shake, rings)

---

## [5.2.3] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- Background star colors improved: 55% blue-white, 25% white, 12% warm,

- Gradient caching for engine exhaust, health bars, and asteroid tiers
  (~30-60 fewer `createLinearGradient`/`createRadialGradient` calls per frame)
- Reduced `ctx.save()`/`restore()` calls by ~70-140 per frame in particle.js
  (replaced with manual property resets)
- HSL template literals in particle.js and line-debris.js replaced with
  cached `hsl()` calls
- `Date.now()` calls in player.js `draw()` replaced with `frameClock.now`
- Pre-allocated typed arrays (Float32Array) for off-screen indicators
- Swap-and-pop removal for damage numbers (O(1) vs splice O(n))

## [5.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Depth-batch-renderer crash after several waves: bucket index could exceed
  0-10 range; added `Math.max`/`Math.min` clamping
- Stars drifting when player is stationary: added epsilon snap
  (`if abs(vel) < 0.05, vel = 0`)
- Stars moving during PAUSE/SHOP: pass `{x:0,y:0}` instead of player velocity

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Hull outline glow on player ship: full silhouette stroke that dims/brightens
  with thrust level but stays visible at idle (cyan, lineWidth 2.5)
- Non-rotating hit flash aesthetic for enemies and asteroids: world-space white
  square with 6-7 debris squares (cyan, magenta, yellow, lavender) bursting
  outward radially
- Hit flash jitter (high-frequency sine displacement)
- Kill juice hierarchy: deaths use stronger effects than hits
  - Enemy kill: hitstop 8, camera kick 14px, screen flash 0.12/3f
  - Asteroid kill: hitstop 4-6, camera kick 7-12px, screen flash 0.06-0.1/2f
- Screen flash overlay system: `triggerScreenFlash(alpha, duration)` renders
  additive white fullscreen rect after HUD
- Camera kick system: `triggerCameraKick(dx, dy, magnitude)` with directional
  lurch and exponential decay
- Hitstop system: `triggerHitstop(frames)` freezes game logic while still
  rendering
- Staggered explosion rings on enemy/asteroid death (3 rings, 50ms apart)
- Directional shrapnel streaks on death (16-24 pieces in entity color)
- Lingering embers on death (10-16 slow-drifting glowing dots)
- Delayed secondary burst sparks (80ms after death)

### Fixed
- Hit flash rotating for enemies but not asteroids: moved all flash drawing
  outside entity rotation transforms to world-space
- Chromatic aberration fuzz looking sloppy on large entities: replaced offset
  colored rectangles with small debris squares
